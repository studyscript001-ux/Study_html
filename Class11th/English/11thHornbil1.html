                <div class="answer">
                    The three phases were:<br>
                    1. Childhood in the village: They were close companions. She woke him up, got him ready for school, and accompanied him to the temple school.<br>
                    2. City life: When they moved to the city, their relationship changed. He went to an English school by bus, and she could no longer accompany him or help with his studies.<br>
                    3. University years: When he went to university, the common link of their friendship was snapped. She accepted her seclusion with resignation and spent most of her time spinning and praying.

                <div class="answer">
                    The grandmother was disturbed because:<br>
                    1. There was no teaching about God and scriptures in the English school.<br>
                    2. She could not help him with his lessons as they involved English and Western science.<br>
                    3. She was unhappy when music lessons were introduced, as she considered music to be associated with harlots and beggars, not meant for gentlefolk.

                    After the author grew up, his grandmother:<br>
                    1. Spent most of her time at her spinning wheel, spinning and reciting prayers from sunrise to sunset.<br>
                    2. Took a break in the afternoon to feed sparrows, which was the happiest half-hour of her day.<br>
                    3. Rarely talked to anyone and accepted her seclusion with resignation.

                <div class="answer">
                    The evening before she died, instead of praying as she normally did, she collected the women of the neighborhood, got an old drum, and started singing. For several hours, she thumped the sagging skins of the dilapidated drum and sang of the home-coming of warriors. This was unusual as she had never missed her prayers before.

                <div class="answer">
                    When the grandmother died, thousands of sparrows sat scattered on the floor in the verandah and her room, right up to where she lay dead. There was no chirruping. They took no notice of the bread crumbs offered to them by the author's mother. When the grandmother's corpse was carried off, they flew away quietly, expressing their sorrow through their silent mourning.

                <div class="answer">
                    We know the grandmother was religious through:<br>
                    1. Her constant prayer: She was always telling the beads of her rosary and her lips constantly moved in inaudible prayer.<br>
                    2. Morning prayers: She said her morning prayer in a monotonous sing-song while bathing and dressing the author.<br>
                    3. Reading scriptures: She sat inside the temple reading scriptures while the author learned at school.<br>
                    4. Devotion: Even when she came to see the author off at the station, her mind was lost in prayer.<br>
                    5. Final moments: She spent her last moments praying and telling her beads.

                <div class="answer">
                    The relationship between the author and his grandmother evolved through different phases:<br>
                    1. Childhood: They were very close companions in the village.<br>
                    2. City life: Their interaction decreased as he attended an English school and she couldn't relate to his studies.<br>
                    3. University: The common link of friendship snapped as he got his own room.<br>
                    Despite these changes, their underlying love and respect for each other remained constant. This is evident when she came to see him off at the station without showing emotion but silently kissed his forehead, and when he cherished that moist imprint. Their feelings didn't change, only the expression of them did.

                <div class="answer">
                    Yes, the grandmother was definitely a person of strong character. This is shown through:<br>
                    1. Her acceptance of change: When the author moved to the city school and later university, she accepted her seclusion with resignation without complaint.<br>
                    2. Her convictions: She held strong beliefs about what was appropriate (like her disapproval of music lessons) and didn't compromise them.<br>
                    3. Her independence: She developed her own routines of spinning and feeding sparrows without depending on others for company.<br>
                    4. Her dignified farewell: When the author left for abroad, she didn't show emotion but silently kissed his forehead.<br>
                    5. Her acceptance of death: She calmly accepted that her end was near and spent her last moments in prayer.

                    [This is a personal question. Students should answer based on their own experiences. Example answer:] Yes, I had a grandmother who was very similar - deeply religious, always praying, and very affectionate. When she passed away, I felt a profound sense of loss similar to what the author describes. Her absence created a void that couldn't be filled, and I still cherish the memories of the time we spent together.

                    Based on the context of the story, the author and his grandmother likely communicated in their mother tongue or regional language. Since the grandmother was not familiar with English (as evidenced by her inability to help with English lessons), and the story is set in India, they probably spoke in their native language, which could be Hindi or another regional Indian language.

                    My maternal grandmother was a remarkable woman whom I deeply admired. She had a gentle demeanor and a warm smile that could light up any room. Despite facing many hardships in her life, she never lost her positive outlook. She had a small garden where she grew vegetables and flowers, and she would often tell me stories while we worked in the garden together. Her hands, though wrinkled with age, were always busy - either knitting sweaters for the family or preparing delicious meals. She had a special way of making everyone feel loved and valued. Even though she passed away five years ago, her teachings about kindness, patience, and the importance of family continue to guide me. I miss her dearly, especially her comforting presence and the wisdom she shared so freely.

                <div class="answer">
                    The word 'cardboard' refers to the photograph mount or the stiff backing on which the photograph is pasted. The poet uses this word to emphasize how the photograph, though physically preserved, represents a moment that is long gone and cannot be brought back.

                <div class="answer">
                    The camera has captured a happy moment from the poet's mother's childhood - a seaside holiday with her two girl cousins. The three of them are holding hands and smiling at the uncle who is taking their photograph.

                <div class="answer">
                    The sea has not changed over the years. This suggests the permanence of nature in contrast to the transient nature of human life. While human beings grow old and die, nature remains largely unchanged.

                <div class="answer">
                    The mother's laugh indicated her nostalgic recollection of a happy moment from her childhood. It shows how she cherished that memory but also recognized how much time had passed since then.

                <div class="answer">
                    This line means that both the mother's past (the sea holiday) and the poet's present (her mother's laughter) are connected by the experience of loss. The mother has lost her childhood, and the poet has lost her mother. The phrase "laboured ease" suggests that although they try to accept these losses with apparent ease, it actually requires effort.

                    "This circumstance" refers to the poet's present situation where her mother has been dead for nearly as many years as the girl in the photograph (the mother) had lived. It highlights the irony and pain of this timing.

                    3. The poet's present: After her mother's death, reflecting on the photograph and the passage of time.
