                <div class="answer">
                    <p>The opening lines of the original song in Hindi are: "ऐ मेरे वतन के लोगों, तुम खूब लगा लो नारा"। The singer is Lata Mangeshkar. In the picture, we see many Indian soldiers and citizens gathered at a function in Delhi.</p>

                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>The Company's "superior weapons" refers to the advanced military technology that the British East India Company possessed, such as modern firearms, cannons, and warships, which were more advanced than the traditional weapons used by Indian rulers.</p>

                <div class="answer">
                    <p>An artisan is a skilled craft worker who makes things by hand. The artisans suffered because the British policies favored imported goods from England and imposed heavy taxes on local products, which destroyed Indian handicrafts and industries.</p>

                    <p>1. Do you think the Indian princes were short-sighted in their approach to the events of 1757?</p>
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>Yes, the Indian princes were short-sighted. They were busy fighting among themselves and failed to see the larger threat posed by the British. They often sought British help against their rivals, not realizing that this would eventually lead to their own downfall.</p>

                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>The East India Company subdued the Indian princes by taking advantage of their rivalries, using superior weapons, and following the policy of "divide and rule." They supported one prince against another and gradually extended their control over all of India.</p>

                        <h5>Story: The Clever Fox and the Foolish Goat</h5>
                        <p>One day, a fox accidentally fell into a deep well. She tried to jump out but couldn't. She was wondering how to get out when a goat happened to pass by.</p>
                        <p>The goat peeked into the well and asked, "Hello! Is this water sweet?" The clever fox saw an opportunity and replied, "Oh yes! It's too sweet! I've had so much, I might faint."</p>
                        <p>Hearing this, the thirsty goat immediately jumped into the well. As the goat drank water, the fox quickly climbed onto the goat's back and jumped out of the well.</p>
                        <p>Before leaving, the fox said, "Thanks for the help. Come out when you can." The goat realized her mistake and remembered her mother's advice: "Be careful how you take the advice of people you don't know."</p>
                        <p>The moral of the story is: Never trust strangers blindly and think before you act.</p>

                    <h4>3. Paragraph on the new method of teaching history</h4>
                    <div class="answer">
                        <p>I think the new method of teaching history through comic books is an excellent idea. History can sometimes seem boring to students when taught through traditional textbooks, but comics make it engaging and fun. When students read comic strips, enact historical characters, and have discussions, they remember the events better. This method encourages participation from all students and helps them understand what historical characters might have been thinking. Using visual aids like comics appeals to different learning styles and makes complex historical events easier to understand. This innovative approach should be adopted in more schools to make learning history enjoyable.</p>

                        <p>The events described in this comic correspond to chapters about the British rule in India, specifically:
                        <ul>
                            <li>The expansion of the East India Company's power (1757-1849)</li>
                            <li>British economic policies and their impact on India</li>
                            <li>Social reforms during the British period</li>
                            <li>The Revolt of 1857 and its causes</li>
                        </ul>
                        The information that would normally span several chapters in a history book has been condensed into a few pages using pictures and speech bubbles, making it more accessible and engaging for students.</p>

                        <p><strong>Title:</strong> The Quarrel Between the Sun and the Wind</p>
                        <p><strong>Panel 1:</strong> The Sun and Wind are arguing. Sun says, "I'm stronger than you!" Wind replies, "No, I'm stronger!"</p>
