                <div class="answer">
                    <p>No, Ignesious did not immediately worry about a tsunami. He was more concerned about his television set and took time to carefully place it on the ground. The sentence that shows they didn't have time to plan is: "Then the family rushed out of the house."</p>

                    <p>Both Meghna and Almas were young girls who were swept away by tsunami waves. Both lost their families and struggled to survive in the water by holding onto floating objects (a wooden door and a log of wood). Both were eventually rescued but were traumatized by their experiences.</p>

                <div class="answer">
                    <p>Tilly's parents could have ignored her warnings or scolded her for being hysterical. Instead, they trusted her and acted quickly. If I were in their place, I would have also listened to my child, especially when she was so upset and was referring to something she had learned in school.</p>

                <div class="answer">
                    <p>Tilly should share the award with her geography teacher who taught her about tsunamis and her parents who trusted and listened to her.</p>

                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>The two ideas are: (1) Animals have a sixth sense that helps them detect approaching disasters. (2) Animals have more acute hearing that helps them hear or feel the earth's vibration. I find the second idea more believable as it is based on animals' heightened senses rather than supernatural abilities.</p>

                        <p><strong>31 December, 2004</strong><br>
                        The killer tsunami struck these islands five days ago. But the victims are being brought in even now. Each one has a story to tell. Today I met a young girl named Meghna who floated in the sea for two days holding onto a wooden door. She lost both her parents but somehow survived. Her courage is incredible.</p>
                        <p>I also heard about Sanjeev, a policeman who saved his family but died trying to save the cook's wife. His bravery reminds me that even in the darkest times, there are heroes among us.</p>
                        <p>The people here have lost everything, yet they show remarkable resilience. They are helping each other and working together to rebuild their lives. It's heartbreaking to see their suffering, but inspiring to witness their strength.</p>

                    <h4>2. Classroom Learning Helping Outside</h4>
                    <div class="answer">
                        <p>Last summer, my family went on a trek in the mountains. During our hike, my younger sister accidentally touched a poisonous plant and her hand started swelling. I remembered from my science class that applying mud mixed with water could help draw out the poison and reduce swelling. I quickly made a mud paste and applied it to her hand. Within minutes, the swelling started to reduce and the pain lessened. My parents were amazed and grateful that I remembered this lesson. It felt good to use classroom knowledge in a real-life situation to help someone.</p>

                <p>When the jet sprang into the sky,<br>
                it was clear why the city<br>
                had developed the way it had,<br>
                seeing it scaled six inches to the mile.<br>
                There seemed an inevitability<br>
                about what on ground had looked haphazard,<br>
                unplanned and without style<br>
                When the jet sprang into the sky.</p>
                
                <p>When the jet reached ten thousand feet,<br>
                it was clear why the country<br>
                had cities where the rivers ran<br>
                and why the valleys were populated.<br>
                The logic of geography —<br>
                that land and water attracted man —<br>
                was clearly delineated<br>
                When the jet reached ten thousand feet.</p>
                
                <p>When the jet rose six miles high,<br>
                it was clear the earth was round<br>
                and that it had more sea than land.<br>
                But it was difficult to understand<br>
                that the men on the earth found<br>
                causes to hate each other, to build<br>
                walls across cities and to kill.<br>
                From that height, it was not clear why.</p>
