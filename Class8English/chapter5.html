                    <p>(i) The three qualities that played a major role in the author's climb are endurance, persistence, and will power.</p>
                    <p>(ii) Adventure is pleasurable because it presents great difficulties that man takes delight in overcoming. The demonstration of physical qualities like endurance and persistence is exhilarating.</p>
                    <p>(iii) The author found Mount Everest irresistible because it is the highest, the mightiest, and had defied many previous attempts. It presents the ultimate challenge to a climber.</p>
                    <p>(iv) One does it for the sense of fulfillment, the satisfaction of rising above one's surroundings, and the eternal love for adventure in man.</p>
                    <p>(v) The emotion is humility.</p>
                    <p>(vi) The "symbols of reverence" left by members of the team were: a picture of Guru Nanak, a picture of Goddess Durga, a relic of the Buddha, and a cross buried under a cairn.</p>
                    <p>(vii) His experience as an Everester taught him to face life's ordeals resolutely and that the conquest of internal summits is equally worthwhile as climbing physical mountains.</p>

                    <p>(v) The physical conquest of a mountain is really a spiritual experience.<br>

                        <p><strong>A Visit to the Himalayas</strong></p>
                        <p>Last summer, I had the opportunity to visit the majestic Himalayas with my family. As we approached the mountains, the air became crisper and cooler, and the scenery transformed from bustling cities to serene landscapes.</p>
                        <p>The journey to the hill station was an adventure in itself. The winding roads offered breathtaking views of valleys covered in lush green forests, with rivers flowing like silver ribbons through them. When we reached our destination, the first thing that struck me was the absolute silence, broken only by the sound of birds and the gentle rustling of leaves.</p>
                        <p>Waking up early the next morning, I witnessed a spectacular sunrise. The first rays of the sun touched the snow-capped peaks, turning them golden. It was a mystical experience that made me feel connected to nature in a way I had never felt before.</p>
                        <p>We went for several treks during our stay. Each trek revealed new wonders - hidden waterfalls, colorful flowers, and occasionally, glimpses of wildlife. The higher we climbed, the more spectacular the views became. From the top of one particularly high point, we could see layers of mountains stretching into the distance, with clouds floating below us.</p>
                        <p>The visit to the hills was not just a vacation; it was a spiritual journey. The grandeur of the mountains made my everyday problems seem small and insignificant. I returned home not just with photographs, but with a renewed sense of peace and perspective that has stayed with me ever since.</p>

                <p>I love to rise in a summer morn,<br>
                When the birds sing on every tree;<br>
                The distant huntsman winds his horn,<br>
                And the skylark sings with me.<br>
                O! what sweet company.</p>
                
                <p>But to go to school in a summer morn,<br>
                O! it drives all joy away;<br>
                Under a cruel eye outworn,<br>
                The little ones spend the day,<br>
                In sighing and dismay.</p>
                
                <p>Ah! then at times I drooping sit,<br>
                And spend many an anxious hour.<br>
                Nor in my book can I take delight,<br>
                Nor sit in learning's bower,<br>
                Worn thro' with the dreary shower.</p>
                
                <p>How can the bird that is born for joy,<br>
                Sit in a cage and sing.<br>
                How can a child when fears annoy,<br>
                But droop his tender wing,<br>
                And forget his youthful spring.</p>
                
                <p>O! Father and Mother, if buds are nip'd,<br>
                And blossoms blown away,<br>
                And if the tender plants are strip'd<br>
                Of their joy in the springing day,<br>
                By sorrow and cares dismay,</p>
                
                <p>How shall the summer arise in joy,<br>
                Or the summer fruits appear?</p>
