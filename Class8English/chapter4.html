                <div class="answer">
                    <p>The man stared at Bepin Babu in disbelief because Bepin Babu claimed he had never been to Ranchi, while the man (Parimal Ghose) had clear memories of arranging Bepin Babu's trip to Ranchi in 1958 and spending time with him there.</p>

                <div class="answer">
                    <p>Bepin Babu worried because Parimal Ghose knew many intimate details about his personal life, which made him doubt his own memory about the Ranchi trip.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="question">

                <div class="answer">
                    <p>He tried to check his right knee for an old injury mark that Parimal had mentioned. He also considered calling Dinesh Mukerji, who was supposedly in Ranchi at the same time.</p>

                <div class="answer">
                    <p>Bepin Babu hesitated because he thought it would be ridiculous to ask Dinesh about the Ranchi trip if he had never been there. He finally decided to phone him to settle the question without showing his embarrassment in person.</p>

                <div class="answer">
                    <p>Mr Mukerji confirmed that he had been to Ranchi in 1958 and that Bepin Babu was there too. This added to Bepin Babu's worries and made him doubt his own memory even more.</p>

                <div class="answer">
                    <p>Chunilal was an old school friend of Bepin Babu who was going through financial difficulties. He wanted Bepin Babu to help him find a job.</p>

                <div class="answer">
                    <p>Dr Chanda was puzzled because Bepin Babu remembered everything except one particular incident (the Ranchi trip). This was unusual as memory loss typically affects multiple memories, not just one specific event.</p>

                    <p>No, Bepin Babu had not really lost his memory. He had never been to Ranchi. The entire episode was an elaborate trick played by Chunilal to teach Bepin Babu a lesson for not helping an old friend in need.</p>

                <div class="answer">
                    <p>Evidence includes:

                        <li>He worked for a big firm and had a responsible job</li>

                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>Bepin Babu changed his mind because he thought Chunilal might remember something about the 1958 Ranchi trip. The result was that Chunilal also confirmed that Bepin Babu had gone to Ranchi, further deepening his confusion.</p>

                <div class="question">

                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>Bepin Babu lost consciousness due to extreme mental stress and anxiety about his supposed memory loss. The realization that he didn't recognize any places in Ranchi despite everyone claiming he had been there caused him to collapse.</p>

                <div class="answer">
                    <p>Initially, Bepin Babu might have felt angry and embarrassed. However, he probably realized the lesson Chunilal was trying to teach him about helping friends in need. He might have felt ashamed of his earlier behavior.</p>

                        I received your letter and must admit I was initially angry about the trick you played on me. But after thinking about it, I realize I deserved it for not helping you when you needed me most.<br><br>

            <div class="poem">
                <p>"Come and hire me," I cried, while in the morning<br>
                I was walking on the stone-paved road.<br>
                Sword in hand the King came in his chariot.<br>
                He held my hand and said, "I will hire you with my power,"<br>
                But his power counted for naught, and he went away in his chariot.</p>
                
                <p>In the heat of the mid-day the houses stood with shut doors.<br>
                I wandered along the crooked lane.<br>
                An old man came out with his bag of gold.<br>
                He pondered and said, "I will hire you with my money."<br>
                He weighed his coins one by one, but I turned away.</p>
                
                <p>It was evening. The garden hedge was all afflower.<br>
                The fair maid came out and said, "I will hire you with a smile."<br>
                Her smile paled and melted into tears, and she went back alone into the dark.</p>
                
                <p>The sun glistened on the sand, and the sea waves broke waywardly.<br>
                A child sat playing with shells.<br>
                He raised his head and seemed to know me and said, "I hire you with nothing."<br>
                From henceforward that bargain struck in child's play made me a free man.</p>

                <div class="answer">
                    <p>He turned down the offer because he realized that money cannot buy happiness or true fulfillment. He was looking for something more meaningful than material wealth.</p>

                    <p>After talking to the child, the speaker felt truly free and happy. The bargain made with the child, which required nothing in return, gave him a sense of true freedom and fulfillment that power, money, or false happiness could not provide.</p>
