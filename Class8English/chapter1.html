                <div class="question">
                    <p>1. For how long do you think Connie had kept Jim's letter? Give reasons for your answer.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>Connie had kept Jim's letter for more than 70 years. We know this because the letter was written in 1914 and Connie was 101 years old when the narrator visited her. She had preserved it carefully in a tin box with instructions to bury it with her when she died.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="question">
                    <p>2. Why do you think the desk had been sold, and when?</p>
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>The desk was probably sold after Connie's house caught fire. The house was badly damaged and became a "burned-out shell." During this difficult time, her belongings might have been sold off, and the damaged desk ended up in a junk shop.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="question">
                    <p>3. Why do Jim and Hans think that games or sports are good ways of resolving conflicts? Do you agree?</p>
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>Jim and Hans believed that sports are good for resolving conflicts because in sports, "no one dies, no children are orphaned, and no wives become widows." Unlike war, sports allow for peaceful competition without loss of life. Yes, I agree because sports build friendship and understanding between opponents, while war only brings destruction.</p>

                <div class="question">
                    <p>4. Do you think the soldiers of the two armies are like each other, or different from each other? Find evidence from the story to support your answer.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>The soldiers of both armies were very much alike. They all longed for peace and wanted to return to their families. Evidence from the story includes: they celebrated Christmas together, shared food and drinks, played football, and talked about their families. Hans said, "I think that is what every soldier wants, on both sides."</p>

                    <p>5. Mention the various ways in which the British and the German soldiers become friends and find things in common at Christmas.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>The British and German soldiers became friends by:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Wishing each other "Happy Christmas"</li>
                        <li>Meeting in no man's land without weapons</li>
                        <li>Sharing schnapps, sausage, rum and Christmas cake</li>
                        <li>Talking about their families and interests</li>
                        <li>Playing a football match together</li>
                        <li>Singing carols together in the evening</li>
                    </ul>
                    They discovered they had many common interests and similar desires for peace.</p>

                <div class="question">
                    <p>6. What is Connie's Christmas present? Why is it "the best Christmas present in the world"?</p>
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>Connie's Christmas present was the return of her husband Jim's last letter. It was "the best Christmas present in the world" because she mistakenly believed that the narrator was her husband Jim who had finally returned home from the war as he had promised. The letter brought back precious memories and gave her immense happiness.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="question">
                    <p>7. Do you think the title of this story is suitable for it? Can you think of any other title(s)?</p>
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>Yes, the title is very suitable because the letter truly was the best Christmas present for Connie. Other possible titles could be "Jim's Last Letter" or "The Christmas Truce" or "A Promise Kept."</p>

                        <p><strong>25 December, 1919</strong><br>
                        It's Christmas today, but the town looks different from how I remembered it. Many buildings that were damaged during the war are still being repaired. There's a sense of sadness in the air, as many families lost their loved ones in the war. I met my old friend Mr. Thompson at the town square. He lost his son in the battle. I wish this war had never happened. The Christmas truce of 1914 showed that we soldiers were all the same - we all wanted peace and to return to our families. I'm grateful to be back home with Connie, but I'll never forget the friends I lost.</p>

                        <p><strong>Letter to a Friend</strong><br><br>
                        Dear Sarah,<br><br>
                        I'm writing to you today with a very heavy heart. Something extraordinary happened that has left me confused and anxious. I found an old letter in a desk I bought and went to return it to its owner, an elderly lady named Connie Macpherson.<br><br>
                        When I met her, she mistook me for her husband Jim who had died in the war. Her eyes lit up with such joy and recognition that I didn't have the heart to tell her I wasn't Jim. She was so happy, calling me her "best Christmas present in the world."<br><br>
                        Now I'm torn between telling her the truth and breaking her heart or letting her live in this beautiful illusion. What would you do in my place? She's 101 years old and has been waiting for her husband to return all these years. Would it be cruel to take away this moment of happiness from her?<br><br>
                        I need your advice desperately.<br><br>
                        Yours,<br>
                        Michael</p>

                <div class="question">
                    <p>1. The cricket says, "Oh! what will become of me?" When does he say it, and why?</p>
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>The cricket says this when winter comes and he finds himself with no food stored. His cupboard is empty, there's no crumb on the snow-covered ground, and he can't find any flower or leaf to eat. He says this because he's hungry, cold, and afraid he might die of starvation.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="question">
                    <p>2. (i) Find in the poem the lines that mean the same as "Neither a borrower nor a lender be".</p>
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>The lines are: "But we ants never borrow; we ants never lend."</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="question">
                    <p>2. (ii) What is your opinion of the ant's principles?</p>
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>The ant's principles are practical and responsible. It's important to save for difficult times and not depend on others. However, the ant could have been a little more compassionate toward the cricket who was in genuine need.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="question">
                    <p>3. The ant tells the cricket to "dance the winter away". Do you think the word 'dance' is appropriate here? If so, why?</p>
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>Yes, the word 'dance' is appropriate because it sarcastically refers to how the cricket spent his time singing and dancing during summer instead of gathering food. Now in winter, when he has no food, the ant mockingly tells him to continue dancing.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="question">
                    <p>4. (i) Which lines in the poem express the poet's comment? Read them aloud.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>The poet's comment is in the last two lines: "Folks call this a fable. I'll warrant it true: Some crickets have four legs, and some have two."</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="question">
                    <p>4. (ii) Write the comment in your own words.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>The poet says that although this story is called a fable, its moral is true for humans too. Just like the four-legged cricket, some two-legged humans (people) also waste their time in enjoyment instead of preparing for their future.</p>
