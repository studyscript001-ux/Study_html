                    <p>Jody's father, Penny, had been bitten by a rattlesnake.</p>

                <div class="answer">
                    <p>The doe's heart and liver were used to draw out the poison from Penny's body, which saved his life.</p>

                    <p>Jody wants to bring the fawn home because he feels it would be ungrateful to leave it to starve after they killed its mother to save his father's life.</p>

                <div class="answer">
                    <p>Jody knows the fawn is a male because its spots are all in a line. On a female fawn, the spots are scattered "every which way."</p>

                <div class="answer">
                    <p>Jody didn't want Mill-wheel with him because:
                    <ul>
                        <li>If the fawn was dead or couldn't be found, he didn't want anyone to see his disappointment.</li>
                        <li>If the fawn was there, the meeting would be so special and secret that he didn't want to share it with anyone.</li>

                <div class="answer">
                    <p>Mill-wheel was afraid to leave Jody alone because he was worried Jody might get lost or get bitten by a snake like his father did.</p>

                <div class="answer">
                    <p>Jody carried the fawn in his arms. When his arms got tired, he let the fawn follow him, and when it got tired, he carried it again.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="question">
                    <p>2. Jody was filled with emotion after he found the fawn. Can you find at least three words or phrases which show how he felt?</p>

                <div class="answer">
                    <p>Words/phrases that show Jody's emotions: "delirious", "enchanted", "light-headed with his joy".</p>

                <div class="question">
                    <p>3. How did the deer drink milk from the gourd?</p>
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>Jody dipped his fingers in the milk and let the fawn suck them. Then he slowly lowered his fingers into the milk until the fawn learned to drink directly from the gourd.</p>

                <div class="answer">
                    <p>The fawn was probably too young and unsure about climbing steps, or it might have been frightened by the unfamiliar structure.</p>

                    <p>1. Why did Penny Baxter allow Jody to go find the fawn and raise it?</p>
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>Penny allowed Jody to find and raise the fawn because he felt it would be ungrateful to leave it to starve after they had killed its mother to save his life. He also recognized Jody's compassion and responsibility.</p>

                <div class="question">
                    <p>2. What did Doc Wilson mean when he said, "Nothing in the world ever comes quite free"?</p>
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>Doc Wilson meant that everything has a cost or consequence. In this case, using the doe's life to save Penny's came with the responsibility of caring for the orphaned fawn.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="question">
                    <p>3. How did Jody look after the fawn, after he accepted the responsibility for doing this?</p>
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>Jody carefully carried the fawn home, fed it milk by first letting it suck his fingers and then teaching it to drink from a gourd, and showed great care and affection toward it.</p>
                </div>

                    <p>4. How does Jody's mother react when she hears that he is going to bring the fawn home? Why does she react in this way?</p>
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>Jody's mother is initially surprised and hesitant. She reacts this way because she's concerned about the practical aspects of caring for a wild animal and the additional responsibility it would bring to their already difficult life.</p>

                    <div class="answer">
                        <p>This is a complex ethical question. In emergency situations like the one in the story, where a human life is at immediate risk, many people would argue that it is justified to kill an animal to save a human. However, we should also consider that every life is valuable, and we should look for alternatives whenever possible. In modern times, we have antivenom and other medical treatments that might reduce the need to kill animals in such situations.</p>

                        <p>My pet dog, Sparky, is a lively and enthusiastic companion who keeps me busy all day. He's frisky and playful, always ready for a game of fetch in the yard. Though he can be naughty sometimes - he often hides the newspaper and drinks up milk if left unattended - his loyalty and happy nature make up for these small mischiefs. After a day of play, he loves to roll in mud, which means bath time is a regular event in our house. Despite the challenges, having Sparky as a friend is wonderful. He's always there to share both joyful moments and quiet times, making every day brighter with his presence.</p>

                    <div class="answer">
                        <p>(i) Natural resources we use: water, air, minerals, forests, fossil fuels, land for agriculture, plants for food and medicine, animals for food and other products.</p>
                        <p>(ii) Our relationship with nature is one of taking without giving back enough. We depend on nature for everything we need to live, from the air we breathe to the food we eat. However, we often exploit natural resources without considering the consequences. We pollute rivers, cut down forests, and harm wildlife habitats. It's important that we learn to live in harmony with nature by conserving resources, reducing pollution, and protecting ecosystems. We should remember that we are part of nature, not separate from it, and our well-being is directly connected to the health of our planet.</p>

                    <h4>3. What to do if a snake bites you</h4>
                    <div class="answer">
                        <p>If a snake bites you, it's important to stay calm and seek medical help immediately. Not all snakes are poisonous, but it's best to treat every bite as potentially dangerous. Keep the bitten area still and positioned below the level of your heart. Remove any tight clothing or jewelry near the bite. Don't try to suck out the venom or cut the wound. Don't apply a tourniquet or ice. Try to remember the snake's appearance to help doctors identify it and provide the right antivenom if needed. While waiting for help, keep the person calm and still to slow the spread of venom if it is a poisonous snake.</p>
