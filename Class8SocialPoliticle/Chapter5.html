        <!-- Question 1 -->
        <div class="card">
            <div class="question-header p-4 sm:p-5">
                <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-emerald-800">1. Write in your own words two or more sentences of what you understand by the word ‘marginalisation’.</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="answer-body p-4 sm:p-5">
                <p>Marginalisation means being forced to the side or edge of society, and not being part of the mainstream. It is a feeling of being excluded, where a person or a community does not have equal access to resources, opportunities, and power, which leads to disadvantage and a sense of powerlessness.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Question 2 -->
        <div class="card">
            <div class="question-header p-4 sm:p-5">
                <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-emerald-800">2. List two reasons why Adivasis are becoming increasingly marginalised.</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="answer-body p-4 sm:p-5">
                <p>Two key reasons for the increasing marginalisation of Adivasis are:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mt-2">
                    <li><strong>Loss of Land and Forests:</strong> Their forest lands have been taken over for mining, industries, and development projects like dams. This has forced them to leave their traditional homes and lose their main source of livelihood and food.</li>
                    <li><strong>Displacement and Poverty:</strong> After being displaced, many Adivasis migrate to cities where they work for very low wages. This pushes them into a cycle of poverty and they lose their unique customs and way of life.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Question 3 -->
        <div class="card">
            <div class="question-header p-4 sm:p-5">
                <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-emerald-800">3. Write one reason why you think the Constitution’s safeguards to protect minority communities are very important?</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="answer-body p-4 sm:p-5">
                <p>The Constitution's safeguards are very important because they protect minority communities from being culturally dominated by the majority community. This ensures that India's cultural diversity is protected and promotes the values of equality and justice for all citizens, regardless of their community's size.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <!-- Question 4 -->
        <div class="card">
            <div class="question-header p-4 sm:p-5">
                <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-emerald-800">4. Re-read the section on Minorities and Marginalisation. What do you understand by the term minority?</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="answer-body p-4 sm:p-5">
                <p>The term 'minority' usually refers to communities that are small in number compared to the rest of the population. However, the concept is not just about numbers. It also includes issues of power, access to resources, and social and cultural dimensions, where a smaller community can feel disadvantaged or dominated by the majority community.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Question 5 -->
        <div class="card">
            <div class="question-header p-4 sm:p-5">
                <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-emerald-800">5. You are participating in a debate where you have to provide reasons to support the following statement: ‘Muslims are a marginalised community’. List two reasons that you would give.</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="answer-body p-4 sm:p-5">
                <p>Using the data from the chapter, I would give the following two reasons:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mt-2">
                    <li><strong>Lack of Access to Basic Amenities:</strong> The data shows that a lower percentage of Muslims have access to basic amenities like pucca houses, electricity, and tap water compared to other religious communities.</li>
                    <li><strong>Low Literacy Rate and Public Employment:</strong> The literacy rate among Muslims (57%) is the lowest among all communities and much below the national average. Their representation in government jobs like the IAS and IPS is also very low compared to their population.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Question 6 -->
        <div class="card">
            <div class="question-header p-4 sm:p-5">
                <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-emerald-800">6. List three things that you would tell her about the lives of Adivasis in India.</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="answer-body p-4 sm:p-5">
                <p>I would tell my friend the following three things about Adivasis:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mt-2">
                    <li>Their lives are not just about dancing; they have rich and diverse cultures, their own languages, and a deep knowledge of forests and medicinal plants.</li>
                    <li>They are not "exotic" or "backward". They are the 'original inhabitants' of India who have been forced out of their forest homes by mining and other projects, leading to poverty.</li>
                    <li>Adivasi societies are often very egalitarian (based on equality), with very little hierarchy or caste-like divisions, which is very different from mainstream society.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <!-- Question 7 -->
        <div class="card">
            <div class="question-header p-4 sm:p-5">
                <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-emerald-800">7. In the storyboard you read about how Helen hopes to make a movie on the Adivasi story. Can you help her by developing a short story on Adivasis?</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="answer-body p-4 sm:p-5">
                <p><strong>Title: Jiya's Mountain</strong></p>
                <p class="mt-2">Jiya, a young Adivasi girl, lived in a small apartment in a big city, but her heart was in her village in Odisha, which she had to leave as a child. One day, her school friend, Priya, visited her. "Why do you always look at that old photo?" Priya asked, pointing to a picture of a green hill.</p>
                <p class="mt-2">"That's not just a hill, it's Niyamgiri, our sacred mountain," Jiya explained. "My grandfather told me that our ancestors' spirits live there. We never cut trees without asking the forest spirits for permission. But then, a company came. They said there was a metal called 'bauxite' under our mountain and they wanted to dig it all up. They promised jobs, but they took our land, our temple, and our river. Now, a big factory stands where my home used to be."</p>
                <p class="mt-2">Priya looked sad. "That's terrible."</p>
                <p>"Yes," Jiya said, a tear rolling down her cheek. "I want to go back and show everyone that our mountain is more precious than any metal. That's my story, the story of my people."</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <!-- Question 8 -->
        <div class="card">
            <div class="question-header p-4 sm:p-5">
                <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-emerald-800">8. Would you agree with the statement that economic marginalisation and social marginalisation are interlinked? Why?</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="answer-body p-4 sm:p-5">
                <p><strong>Yes, I agree that economic and social marginalisation are interlinked.</strong></p>
                <p class="mt-2"><strong>Why:</strong> They create a cycle that is difficult to break. Social marginalisation, which comes from prejudice and being seen as "different" or "backward" (like Adivasis being stereotyped), leads to discrimination. This discrimination prevents them from getting equal access to education and jobs. This lack of opportunity causes economic marginalisation (poverty). In turn, poverty reinforces their low social status and makes it harder for them to access resources, which continues their social marginalisation. The chapter shows this for both Adivasis and Muslims.</p>
