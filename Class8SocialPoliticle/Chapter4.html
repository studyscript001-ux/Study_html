                <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-violet-800">1. Why is an independent judiciary necessary to carry out the function of ‘upholding the law and enforcing Fundamental Rights’?</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="answer-body p-4 sm:p-5">
                <p>An independent judiciary is necessary because:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mt-2">
                    <li>It ensures that there is no misuse of power by the legislature or the executive.</li>
                    <li>It allows judges to make fair and impartial decisions without any pressure or influence from politicians or powerful people.</li>
                    <li>Citizens can trust the courts to protect their Fundamental Rights if the judiciary is independent.</li>

                <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-violet-800">2. How do you think the Right to Constitutional Remedies connects to the idea of judicial review?</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="answer-body p-4 sm:p-5">
                <p>The Right to Constitutional Remedies and judicial review are closely connected:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mt-2">
                    <li><strong>Right to Constitutional Remedies</strong> allows a citizen to go to court if their Fundamental Rights are violated.</li>
                    <li><strong>Judicial Review</strong> is the power of the judiciary to examine laws passed by the Parliament.</li>
                    <li>When a citizen approaches the court using their Right to Constitutional Remedies, the court uses its power of judicial review to check if the law violating the right is constitutional. If the law violates the basic structure of the constitution, the court can declare it invalid.</li>

                <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-violet-800">5. Why is the introduction of Public Interest Litigation (PIL) in the 1980s a significant step in ensuring access to justice for all?</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="answer-body p-4 sm:p-5">
                <p>PIL is a significant step because:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mt-2">
                    <li>It made it easier for the poor and marginalised to get justice, as they often lack the money and time for complex legal procedures.</li>
                    <li>It allows any individual or organisation to file a case in court on behalf of those whose rights are being violated.</li>
                    <li>The legal process was simplified; even a letter or telegram to the court could be treated as a PIL.</li>
                    <li>It helped secure justice for a large number of people on issues like bonded labour and the right to food.</li>

            </div>
            <div class="answer-body p-4 sm:p-5">
                <p>The judges meant that the Right to Life (Article 21) is not just about mere survival or breathing. It means having a life with dignity.</p>
                <p class="mt-2">Since a person cannot live without a means of earning money to get food, shelter, and other basic necessities, the right to earn a livelihood is an essential part of the Right to Life. Evicting someone from their home or pavement could mean taking away their job and thus, their means of livelihood, which is like taking away their life.</p>

            <div class="answer-body p-4 sm:p-5">
                <p>Ramveer, a poor farmer, owned a small piece of land. A powerful landlord in his village forged documents and claimed the land as his own. Ramveer filed a case in the district court. The case dragged on for years. Every hearing date, Ramveer had to travel to the city, spend money he didn't have, and lose a day's wage.</p>
                <p class="mt-2">After 20 long years, the court finally gave a verdict in Ramveer's favour. By then, Ramveer was old and weak. His children had grown up in poverty, unable to get a proper education. He got his land back, but he had lost his youth, health, and his family's future in the long wait. Though he won the case, the delayed justice felt like a denial of the life he could have lived.</p>

                </ul>
                <p class="font-semibold">How does the phrase relate to the photo essay?</p>
                <p>The phrase “Hungry stomachs, overflowing godowns!” directly relates to the photo essay. The essay shows that in 2001, people were starving due to drought, while government godowns were full of grain. The phrase captures this contradiction and the public anger that led to the PIL, which resulted in the Supreme Court ordering the government to implement schemes like the mid-day meal to ensure food reaches the hungry.</p>
