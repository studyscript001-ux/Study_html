        <h2 class="section-title">1. Answer the following questions.</h2>

        <div class="qa-card">
            <p class="question">(i) Why are people considered a resource?</p>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>People are considered the greatest resource for a nation because it is their skills, demands, and abilities that turn natural substances into valuable resources. A healthy, educated, and motivated population develops resources according to their needs and requirements, making human resource the ultimate resource.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="qa-card">
            <p class="question">(ii) What are the causes for the uneven distribution of population in the world?</p>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>The uneven distribution of population is caused by two main sets of factors:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Geographical Factors:</strong> These include topography (people prefer plains over mountains), climate (people avoid extreme hot or cold climates), fertile soil (for agriculture), availability of fresh water, and mineral deposits.</li>
                    <li><strong>Social, Cultural, and Economic Factors:</strong> These include areas with better housing, education, and health facilities (social); places with religious or cultural significance (cultural); and industrial areas that provide employment opportunities (economic).</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="qa-card">
            <p class="question">(iii) The world population has grown very rapidly. Why?</p>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>The world's population has grown very rapidly mainly due to a rapid increase in the natural growth rate. This happened because of significant advancements in food supply and medicine. With better healthcare, the death rate has reduced drastically, but the birth rate has remained high in many parts of the world, leading to a population explosion.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="qa-card">
            <p class="question">(iv) Discuss the role of any two factors influencing population change.</p>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Two key factors influencing population change are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Birth Rate:</strong> This is the number of live births per 1,000 people. A high birth rate leads to population growth, while a low birth rate slows it down.</li>
                    <li><strong>Death Rate:</strong> This is the number of deaths per 1,000 people. A decrease in the death rate, often due to better healthcare and nutrition, leads to population growth.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The difference between the birth rate and the death rate is called the natural growth rate, which is the primary driver of population change.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="qa-card">
            <p class="question">(v) What is meant by population composition?</p>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Population composition refers to the structure of a country's population. It helps us understand the characteristics of the people, such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The number of males and females.</li>
                    <li>The age groups they belong to.</li>
                    <li>Their education and literacy levels.</li>
                    <li>Their occupations and income levels.</li>
                    <li>Their overall health condition.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="qa-card">
            <p class="question">(vi) What are population pyramids? How do they help in understanding the population of a country?</p>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Population pyramids, also known as age-sex pyramids, are graphical representations that show the composition of a country's population.</p>
                <p><strong>They help in understanding the population by showing:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The total population divided into various age groups (e.g., 0-4 years, 5-9 years).</li>
                    <li>The percentage of the total population that is male and female within each age group.</li>
                    <li>The number of dependents (young children below 15 and elderly people above 65) compared to the economically active population (working age).</li>
                    <li>The shape of the pyramid indicates the country's story, such as high birth rates (broad base) or low death rates (wider top).</li>
                </ul>
