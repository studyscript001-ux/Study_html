<p><b>Excercise<br/></b></p>
<p><b>1. Select the correct word from the <br/>following list and fill in the blanks. <br/></b></p>
<p>(a) The same kind of plants grown and <br/>cultivated on a large scale at a place is <br/>called crop.<br/>(b) The first step before growing crops is <br/>preparation of the soil.<br/>(c) Damaged seeds would float on top of <br/>water.<br/>(d) For growing a crop, sufficient <br/>sunlight and nutrients and water from </p>

<p><b>2. Match items in column A with <br/>those in column B:<br/></b>(i) Kharif crops &#8594; (e) Paddy and maize<br/>(ii) Rabi crops &#8594; (d) Wheat, gram, pea<br/>(iii) Chemical fertilisers &#8594; (b) Urea and <br/>super phosphate<br/>(iv) Organic manure &#8594; (c) Animal <br/>excreta, cow dung urine and plant waste<br/></p>
<p><b>3. Give two examples of each:<br/>   </b>(a) Kharif crop: Paddy, Maize<br/>   (b) Rabi crop: Wheat, Gram</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p><b>4. Write a paragraph in your own <br/>words on each of the following:<br/>(a) Preparation of soil:</b> The preparation <br/>of soil is crucial for crop growth. It <br/>involves tilling and leveling the soil to <br/>create a conducive environment for <br/>seed germination. Loosening the soil <br/>allows roots to penetrate deep and <br/>access nutrients and water, which are <br/>essential for healthy plant growth.<br/><b>(b) Sowing:</b> Sowing is the process of <br/>planting seeds in the prepared soil. It is <br/>important to use healthy seeds and sow <br/>them at the right depth and distance to <br/>avoid overcrowding, which can hinder <br/>growth. Proper sowing ensures that the <br/>plants receive adequate sunlight and <br/>nutrients.</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p><b>(c) Weeding:</b> Weeding involves <br/>removing unwanted plants that compete <br/>with crops for resources. Weeds can <br/>affect the growth of crops by consuming <br/>water and nutrients. Regular weeding, <br/>either manually or through the use of <br/>chemicals, is necessary to ensure the <br/>health of the crop.<br/><b>(d) Threshing:</b> Threshing is the process <br/>of separating grains from the chaff after <br/>harvesting. This can be done manually <br/>or using machines like combines. It is an <br/>important step in preparing the produce <br/>for storage and consumption.<br/></p>
<p><b>5. Explain how fertilisers are different <br/>from manure?</b></p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>Answer: Fertilisers are man-made <br/>inorganic substances rich in specific <br/>nutrients, while manure is a natural <br/>organic substance derived from the <br/>decomposition of plant and animal <br/>waste. Fertilisers provide concentrated <br/>nutrients but do not add humus<b> </b>to the <br/>soil, whereas manure enhances soil <br/>structure, increases water retention, and <br/>promotes microbial activity.<br/></p>
<p><b>6. What is irrigation? Describe two <br/>methods of irrigation which conserve <br/>water. <br/></b>Answer: Irrigation is the supply of water <br/>to crops at regular intervals to ensure <br/>their growth. Two methods of irrigation <br/>that conserve water include:</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>1. Drip irrigation, which delivers water <br/>directly to the roots of the plants, <br/>minimizing wastage.<br/>2. Sprinkler irrigation, where water is <br/>sprayed over the crops like rain, which <br/>is effective for uneven land.<br/></p>
<p><b>7. If wheat is sown in the kharif <br/>season, what would happen? <br/>Discuss.<br/></b>Answer: If wheat is sown in the kharif <br/>season, it would not thrive, as wheat is a <br/>rabi crop that requires cooler <br/>temperatures for proper growth. The <br/>warm conditions of the kharif season <br/>would not be suitable for wheat <br/>cultivation.</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p><b>8. Explain how soil gets affected by <br/>the continuous plantation of crops <br/>ina field.<br/></b>Answer: Continuous plantation of crops <br/>in a field can lead to soil nutrient <br/>depletion, making it poor in essential <br/>minerals. This can adversely affect crop <br/>yield and soil health. Farmers often <br/>need to replenish nutrients through the <br/>use of organic manure or chemical <br/>fertilisers.<br/></p>
<p><b>9. What are weeds? How can we <br/>control them?<br/></b>Answer: Weeds are undesired plants <br/>that grow alongside crops and compete </p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>for resources. They can be controlled <br/>through manual removal, chemical <br/>weedicides, or by maintaining proper <br/>crop management practices.<br/></p>

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p><b>Previous Years Q&amp;A<br/>MP Board (2022-25)<br/></b></p>
<p><b>1. Define Agriculture.<br/></b>Answer: Agriculture is the practice of cultivating <br/>soil, growing crops, and rearing animals to <br/>provide food and other products useful to <br/>humans.<br/></p>
<p><b>2. What is soil? Name its constituents.<br/></b>Answer: Soil is the uppermost weathered layer <br/>of the earth&#8217;s crust that supports plant growth.<br/>Constituents of soil: Minerals, water, air, organic <br/>matter (humus), and microorganisms.<br/></p>
<p><b>3. What is humus? State its importance.<br/></b>Answer: Humus is the dark organic material <br/>formed by the decomposition of dead plants and <br/>animals.</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>Importance:<br/>1. Improves soil fertility.<br/>2. Makes soil porous for aeration.<br/>3. Increases water-holding capacity of soil.<br/>4. Supplies essential nutrients to plants.<br/></p>
<p><b>4. How do microbes help in soil fertility?<br/></b>Answer: Microbes decompose organic matter in <br/>the soil and form humus. Some microbes (e.g., <br/>Rhizobium bacteria) fix atmospheric nitrogen, <br/>enriching the soil with nutrients and improving <br/>fertility.<br/></p>
<p><b>5. Differentiate between Kharif and Rabi <br/>crops.<br/></b>Answer: Kharif crops: Sown in rainy season <br/>(June&#8211;September). Example: Paddy, Maize.</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>Rabi crops: Sown in winter season (October&#8211;<br/>March). Example: Wheat, Gram.<br/></p>
<p><b>6. What is manuring? Why is it necessary?<br/></b>Answer: The process of adding organic manure <br/>to soil is called manuring.<br/>Necessity: Continuous cropping reduces soil <br/>nutrients. Manuring replenishes nutrients, <br/>improves soil texture, and ensures healthy plant <br/>growth.<br/></p>
<p><b>7. Distinguish between Fertilisers and <br/>Manure.<br/></b>Answer: Fertilisers are man-made chemicals, <br/>rich in nutrients like NPK, prepared in factories, <br/>and give immediate results but reduce soil <br/>fertility on overuse.<br/>Manure is natural (from plant/animal waste), less <br/>nutrient-rich, but improves soil texture, adds </p>

<p><b>8. What is irrigation? Name two modern <br/>methods which save water.<br/></b>Answer: Irrigation is the supply of water to crops <br/>at regular intervals.<br/>Modern methods conserving water:<br/>1. Sprinkler system &#8211; Sprays water like rainfall, <br/>suitable for uneven lands.<br/>2. Drip system &#8211; Supplies water drop by drop <br/>near roots; no wastage of water.<br/></p>
<p><b>9. What are weeds? How can they be <br/>controlled?<br/></b>Answer: Unwanted plants growing with crops <br/>are called weeds.<br/>Control methods:<br/>1. Manual removal by khurpi.</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>2. Tilling before sowing.<br/>3. Using weedicides (like 2,4-D).<br/></p>
<p><b>10. Why is paddy grown in rainy season <br/>only?<br/></b>Answer: Paddy requires a lot of water for <br/>growth, which is naturally available during the <br/>rainy season.<br/></p>
<p><b>11. Why does continuous cropping make soil <br/>infertile? How can it be improved?<br/></b>Answer: Continuous cropping reduces essential <br/>nutrients from soil.<br/>Improvement methods: Manuring, adding <br/>fertilisers, and crop rotation with legumes.<br/></p>
<p><b>12. Why should seeds be sown at proper <br/>depth and spacing?</b></p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>Answer: Seeds at proper depth are safe from <br/>birds and get moisture for germination. Proper <br/>spacing avoids overcrowding, ensuring enough <br/>sunlight, water, and nutrients for each plant.<br/><b>Download StudyScript App from Google Search <br/></b></p>
