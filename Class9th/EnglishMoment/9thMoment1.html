                <div class="answer">
                    On his way to the fair, the child sees many fascinating things that capture his attention. He is drawn to the toys in the shops along the way, the beautiful mustard fields that look like "melting gold," dragonflies with gaudy purple wings, insects and worms along the footpath, and a grove where young flowers rain down. He lags behind because he is naturally curious and gets easily distracted by these interesting sights. The child's innocence and wonder at the world around him make him stop to explore everything that catches his eye, causing him to fall behind his parents.

                <div class="answer">
                    At the fair, the child wants several things:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Burfi (his favorite sweet) from the sweetmeat seller</li>
                        <li>A garland of gulmohur flowers from the flower-seller</li>
                        <li>Colored balloons (yellow, red, green, and purple) from the balloon-seller</li>
                        <li>To listen to the snake-charmer's music</li>
                        <li>A ride on the roundabout</li>
                    </ul>
                    He moves on without waiting for an answer because he already knows what his parents' response will be. He understands that they will refuse each request - they would say he's greedy for wanting sweets, that flowers are cheap, that he's too old for balloons, that the snake-charmer's music is coarse, and likely that the roundabout is too crowded or dangerous. His previous experiences with their refusals have taught him not to expect a positive response.
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="card">
                <div class="question"><i class="fas fa-question-circle"></i> 3. When does he realise that he has lost his way? How have his anxiety and insecurity been described?</div>
                <div class="answer">
                    The child realizes he has lost his way when he turns to look at his parents after requesting to go on the roundabout and finds they are nowhere to be seen. He looks ahead, on both sides, and behind him, but cannot find them anywhere.
                    <br><br>
                    His anxiety and insecurity are vividly described through:
                    <ul>
                        <li>A "full, deep cry" rising within his dry throat</li>
                        <li>Running in "real fear" while crying "Mother, Father"</li>
                        <li>Tears rolling down "hot and fierce"</li>
                        <li>His flushed face being "convulsed with fear"</li>
                        <li>Running "hither and thither in all directions" in a panic</li>
                        <li>His turban coming untied and clothes becoming muddy</li>
                        <li>His cries turning into suppressed sobs when he becomes exhausted</li>
                        <li>Running through the crowd, nearly getting trampled</li>
                    </ul>
                    These descriptions powerfully convey the child's escalating terror and helplessness as he realizes he is alone in the unfamiliar, crowded fair.

                <div class="question"><i class="fas fa-question-circle"></i> 4. Why does the lost child lose interest in the things that he had wanted earlier?</div>
                <div class="answer">
                    The lost child loses interest in the things he wanted earlier because his primary need has shifted dramatically. When he was with his parents, his desires were for entertainment and pleasure - sweets, toys, and rides. But once separated from them, his fundamental need for safety, security, and the comfort of his parents overwhelms all other wants. The fear and anxiety of being alone in a crowded, unfamiliar place make material desires insignificant. His only thought is to reunite with his parents, and nothing else matters. This shows how our basic needs for security and belonging can override all other desires in times of crisis.

                <div class="answer">
                    While the story ends without explicitly telling us whether the child finds his parents, there are strong indications that he likely does. The man who rescues him from the crowd is kind and tries various methods to comfort him. Given the setting of a village fair where communities are typically close-knit, it's probable that someone would recognize the child or that the parents would be searching for him nearby. The man would likely take the child to a safe place and help locate his parents, perhaps through announcements or by asking around. The child's persistent cries for his parents would also draw attention and potentially help in reuniting them. Though the author leaves it open-ended, the natural conclusion would be that the child is eventually reunited with his worried parents.

                <div class="answer">
                    Based on the story and general safety practices, here are some ways to ensure not to get lost:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Stay close to parents/guardians:</strong> Always keep your parents or guardians in sight, especially in crowded places.</li>
                        <li><strong>Hold hands:</strong> In very crowded areas, hold an adult's hand to maintain physical contact.</li>
                        <li><strong>Establish meeting points:</strong> Agree on a specific meeting point in case you get separated.</li>
                        <li><strong>Memorize contact information:</strong> Know your parents' full names and phone numbers, or keep this information in a safe place.</li>
                        <li><strong>Wear bright clothing:</strong> This makes you more visible in a crowd.</li>
                        <li><strong>Stay in one place if lost:</strong> If you do get separated, stay where you are rather than wandering further.</li>
                        <li><strong>Identify safe people:</strong> Teach children to identify security personnel, police officers, or information desk staff who can help.</li>
                        <li><strong>Pay attention to surroundings:</strong> Notice landmarks that can help you find your way back.</li>
                        <li><strong>Use technology:</strong> For older children, mobile phones with location sharing can be helpful.</li>
