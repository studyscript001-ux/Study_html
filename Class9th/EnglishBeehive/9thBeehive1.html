                    <p>Margie's mother sent for the County Inspector because Margie had been performing poorly in geography. The mechanical teacher had been giving her test after test, and her performance was getting worse.</p>

                    <p>The County Inspector smiled at Margie, gave her an apple, and then took the mechanical teacher apart. He fixed the geography sector which was geared too quick and slowed it down to an average ten-year level.</p>

                    <p>Yes, Margie had regular days and hours for school. Her mechanical teacher was turned on at the same time every day except Saturdays and Sundays because her mother believed that little girls learned better if they learned at regular hours.</p>

                    <p>2. Why did Margie hate school? Why did she think the old kind of school must have been fun?</p>
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>Margie hated school because she found her mechanical teacher boring and frustrating. She was performing poorly in geography, which made her dislike school even more. The mechanical nature of her teacher and the isolated learning environment made the experience joyless for her.</p>
                    <p>She thought the old kind of school must have been fun because all the kids from the neighborhood went together, laughing and shouting in the schoolyard. They sat together in the classroom, learned the same things, could help each other with homework, and went home together at the end of the day. The human interaction and social aspect of traditional schools appealed to her.</p>

                <div class="question">
                    <p>3. Do you agree with Margie that schools today are more fun than the school in the story? Give reasons for your answer.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>Yes, I agree with Margie that schools today are more fun than the school in the story. Traditional schools provide social interaction with classmates, which makes learning more enjoyable. Students can participate in group activities, sports, and extracurricular activities that develop social skills and friendships.</p>
                    <p>Human teachers in today's schools can understand students' emotions, provide personalized attention, and make learning engaging through various teaching methods. The school environment includes playgrounds, libraries, and laboratories that offer diverse learning experiences beyond just academic instruction, making education a more holistic and enjoyable process.</p>

                    <p style="margin: 15px 0;">I have been an avid reader of science fiction, and Isaac Asimov's works have always fascinated me. I am particularly interested in his stories that explore futuristic concepts like the one in "The Fun They Had."</p>
                    
                    <p style="margin: 15px 0;">Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to receiving the book set soon.</p>
