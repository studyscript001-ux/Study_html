                <span class="question-number">1</span>
                <span>How does the force of gravitation between two objects change when the distance between them is reduced to half?</span>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">Answer: According to the universal law of gravitation, the force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the objects. So, if the distance is reduced to half, the force becomes 4 times (since F ∝ 1/d², when d becomes d/2, F becomes 4F).</div>
        </div>

                <span class="question-number">2</span>
                <span>Gravitational force acts on all objects in proportion to their masses. Why then, a heavy object does not fall faster than a light object?</span>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">Answer: Although gravitational force is proportional to mass, the acceleration due to gravity (g) is independent of mass. From Newton's second law (F = ma) and gravitational force (F = G×M×m/d²), we get mg = G×M×m/d², which simplifies to g = G×M/d². So, all objects fall with the same acceleration regardless of their mass.</div>

            <div class="question">
                <span class="question-number">3</span>
                <span>What is the magnitude of the gravitational force between the earth and a 1 kg object on its surface? (Mass of the earth is 6×10²⁴ kg and radius of the earth is 6.4×10⁶ m.)</span>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">Answer: Using the formula F = G×M×m/d²:<br>
            G = 6.7×10⁻¹¹ N m² kg⁻²<br>
            M = 6×10²⁴ kg<br>
            m = 1 kg<br>
            d = 6.4×10⁶ m<br>
            F = (6.7×10⁻¹¹ × 6×10²⁴ × 1) / (6.4×10⁶)² = (4.02×10¹⁴) / (4.096×10¹³) ≈ 9.8 N<br>
            The gravitational force is approximately 9.8 N.</div>

                <span>The earth and the moon are attracted to each other by gravitational force. Does the earth attract the moon with a force that is greater or smaller or the same as the force with which the moon attracts the earth? Why?</span>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">Answer: The earth attracts the moon with the same force as the moon attracts the earth. According to Newton's third law of motion, forces always occur in equal and opposite pairs. The gravitational force between two objects is mutual and equal in magnitude.</div>

                <span>If the moon attracts the earth, why does the earth not move towards the moon?</span>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">Answer: Both the earth and moon move towards each other due to gravitational attraction. However, because the earth has a much larger mass than the moon, its acceleration (a = F/M) is much smaller and not easily noticeable. The moon appears to move more because it has less mass.</div>

            </div>
            <div class="answer">Answer:<br>
            (i) If mass of one object is doubled, the force becomes double (F ∝ m).<br>
            (ii) If distance is doubled, force becomes 1/4 (F ∝ 1/d²). If tripled, force becomes 1/9.<br>
            (iii) If masses of both objects are doubled, force becomes 4 times (F ∝ m₁×m₂).</div>

                <span>What is the acceleration of free fall?</span>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">Answer: The acceleration of free fall is the acceleration experienced by an object when it falls under the influence of gravity alone, without any other forces acting on it (like air resistance). On earth, this acceleration is approximately 9.8 m/s² and is denoted by 'g'.</div>

                <span>Amit buys few grams of gold at the poles as per the instruction of one of his friends. He hands over the same when he meets him at the equator. Will the friend agree with the weight of gold bought? If not, why? [Hint: The value of g is greater at the poles than at the equator.]</span>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">Answer: No, the friend will not agree with the weight of gold bought. The value of g is greater at the poles than at the equator, so the same mass of gold will weigh less at the equator. Since the friend is measuring weight at the equator, he will find the weight to be less than what was measured at the poles.</div>

            </div>
            <div class="answer">Answer: A sheet of paper falls slower than a crumpled paper ball because it has a larger surface area, which experiences more air resistance. The crumpled ball has less surface area exposed to air, so it experiences less air resistance and falls faster.</div>

            <div class="answer">Answer:<br>

                <span>A ball thrown up vertically returns to the thrower after 6 s. Find<br>
                (a) the velocity with which it was thrown up,<br>
                (b) the maximum height it reaches, and<br>
                (c) its position after 4 s.</span>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">Answer:<br>
            Total time = 6 s, so time to reach maximum height = 3 s<br><br>
            (a) Using v = u - gt<br>
            0 = u - 9.8×3<br>
            u = 29.4 m/s<br>
            Initial velocity = 29.4 m/s<br><br>
            (b) Maximum height: h = ut - (1/2)gt²<br>
            h = 29.4×3 - (1/2)×9.8×9<br>
            h = 88.2 - 44.1 = 44.1 m<br>
            Maximum height = 44.1 m<br><br>
            (c) After 4 s, the ball is on its way down<br>
            Position: s = ut - (1/2)gt²<br>
            s = 29.4×4 - (1/2)×9.8×16<br>
            s = 117.6 - 78.4 = 39.2 m<br>
            After 4 s, the ball is 39.2 m above the ground.</div>

                <span>In what direction does the buoyant force on an object immersed in a liquid act?</span>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">Answer: The buoyant force on an object immersed in a liquid acts vertically upward, opposite to the direction of gravity.</div>

                <span>Why does a block of plastic released under water come up to the surface of water?</span>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">Answer: A block of plastic released under water comes up to the surface because the buoyant force (upthrust) acting on it is greater than its weight. The density of plastic is less than the density of water, so it experiences a net upward force.</div>

                <span>The volume of 50 g of a substance is 20 cm³. If the density of water is 1 g cm⁻³, will the substance float or sink?</span>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">Answer: Density of substance = mass/volume = 50 g / 20 cm³ = 2.5 g/cm³<br>
            Density of water = 1 g/cm³<br>
            Since the density of the substance (2.5 g/cm³) is greater than the density of water (1 g/cm³), the substance will sink in water.</div>

                <span>The volume of a 500 g sealed packet is 350 cm³. Will the packet float or sink in water if the density of water is 1 g cm⁻³? What will be the mass of the water displaced by this packet?</span>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">Answer: Density of packet = mass/volume = 500 g / 350 cm³ ≈ 1.43 g/cm³<br>
            Density of water = 1 g/cm³<br>
            Since the density of the packet (1.43 g/cm³) is greater than the density of water (1 g/cm³), the packet will sink in water.<br><br>
            When the packet is fully immersed, it will displace water equal to its own volume (350 cm³).<br>
            Mass of water displaced = volume × density = 350 cm³ × 1 g/cm³ = 350 g</div>
