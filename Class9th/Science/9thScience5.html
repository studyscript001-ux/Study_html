            <div class="answer">
                <p><strong>Mitochondria</strong> are known as the powerhouse of the cell.</p>
                <br>
                <p><strong>Reason:</strong></p>
                <p>Mitochondria are responsible for producing energy in the form of ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate) molecules through cellular respiration. This energy is required for various chemical activities needed for life. The body uses energy stored in ATP for making new chemical compounds and for mechanical work.</p>

                <br>

            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Amoeba obtains its food through a process called <strong>endocytosis</strong>:</p>
                <p>1. Amoeba extends its pseudopodia (false feet) to surround the food particle</p>
                <p>2. The food particle gets enclosed in a food vacuole</p>
                <p>3. Digestive enzymes are secreted into the food vacuole</p>
                <p>4. The food is digested and absorbed</p>
                <p>5. The undigested material is expelled from the cell</p>
                <br>
                <p>This process is possible due to the flexibility of the cell membrane in Amoeba.</p>

                <span>What is osmosis?</span>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p><strong>Osmosis</strong> is the movement of water molecules from a region of higher water concentration to a region of lower water concentration through a selectively permeable membrane.</p>
                <br>
                <p>It is a special case of diffusion where only water molecules move across the membrane. Osmosis plays a crucial role in:</p>
                <p>• Absorption of water by plant roots</p>
                <p>• Movement of water in and out of cells</p>

                <span>Carry out the following osmosis experiment:</span>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p><strong>Experiment Setup:</strong></p>
                <p>Take four peeled potato halves and scoop each one out to make potato cups. One of these potato cups should be made from a boiled potato. Put each potato cup in a trough containing water. Now:</p>
                <p>(a) Keep cup A empty</p>
                <p>(b) Put one teaspoon sugar in cup B</p>
                <p>(c) Put one teaspoon salt in cup C</p>
                <p>(d) Put one teaspoon sugar in the boiled potato cup D</p>
                <p>Keep these for two hours. Then observe the four potato cups.</p>
                <br>
                <p><strong>Observations and Explanations:</strong></p>
                <p>(i) Water gathers in the hollowed portion of B and C because:</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sugar/salt solution inside the cups is hypertonic compared to the water outside. Water moves from the outside (higher water concentration) to the inside (lower water concentration) through osmosis.</p>
                <br>
                <p>(ii) Potato A is necessary as a control experiment to show that without any solute, water does not gather in the hollowed portion.</p>
                <br>
                <p>(iii) Water does not gather in the hollowed portions of A and D because:</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• In A, there is no concentration gradient as both sides have water</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• In D, the boiled potato cells are dead, so the selectively permeable membrane is destroyed and osmosis cannot occur</p>
