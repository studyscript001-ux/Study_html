                <span>What is sound and how is it produced?</span>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                Sound is a form of energy that produces a sensation of hearing in our ears. It is produced by vibrating objects. When an object vibrates, it sets the particles of the surrounding medium into vibration, creating compressions and rarefactions that propagate as sound waves.

                <span>Describe with the help of a diagram, how compressions and rarefactions are produced in air near a source of sound.</span>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                When a vibrating object moves forward, it pushes and compresses the air in front of it, creating a region of high pressure called compression (C). When it moves backward, it creates a region of low pressure called rarefaction (R). As the object vibrates back and forth, a series of compressions and rarefactions are created in the air, forming a sound wave that propagates through the medium.

                <span>Why is sound wave called a longitudinal wave?</span>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                Sound waves are called longitudinal waves because the particles of the medium vibrate parallel to the direction of wave propagation. In these waves, the individual particles move back and forth in the same direction as the wave is traveling, creating regions of compression and rarefaction.

                <span>Which characteristic of the sound helps you to identify your friend by his voice while sitting with others in a dark room?</span>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                The quality or timbre of sound helps us identify different voices. Quality is that characteristic of sound which enables us to distinguish one sound from another having the same pitch and loudness. Each person's vocal cords produce sound with a unique quality that helps us recognize them.

                <span>Flash and thunder are produced simultaneously. But thunder is heard a few seconds after the flash is seen, why?</span>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                This happens because light travels much faster than sound. Light travels at approximately 3 × 10^8 m/s, while sound travels at about 344 m/s in air at 22°C. Therefore, although both are produced at the same time during lightning, we see the flash almost instantly, but the sound takes time to reach our ears.

                <span class="question-number">6</span>
                <span>A person has a hearing range from 20 Hz to 20 kHz. What are the typical wavelengths of sound waves in air corresponding to these two frequencies? Take the speed of sound in air as 344 m s⁻¹.</span>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                Using the formula: Speed (v) = Wavelength (λ) × Frequency (ν)<br><br>
                
                For 20 Hz:<br>
                λ = v/ν = 344/20 = 17.2 m<br><br>
                
                For 20,000 Hz (20 kHz):<br>
                λ = 344/20000 = 0.0172 m = 1.72 cm<br><br>
                
                Therefore, the wavelengths range from 17.2 m to 1.72 cm.

                <span>Two children are at opposite ends of an aluminium rod. One strikes the end of the rod with a stone. Find the ratio of times taken by the sound wave in air and in aluminium to reach the second child.</span>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                From Table 11.1:<br>
                Speed of sound in air at 25°C = 346 m/s<br>
                Speed of sound in aluminium at 25°C = 6420 m/s<br><br>
                
                Time = Distance/Speed<br>
                Since distance is the same for both:<br><br>
                
                Ratio of times = Time in air / Time in aluminium<br>
                = (Distance/346) / (Distance/6420) = 6420/346 ≈ 18.55<br><br>
                
                Therefore, the ratio of times taken is approximately 18.55:1, meaning sound takes about 18.55 times longer to travel through air than through aluminium.

            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                Frequency = 100 Hz, which means 100 vibrations per second.<br><br>
                
                Number of vibrations in one minute (60 seconds) = 100 × 60 = 6000 vibrations<br><br>
                
                Therefore, the source vibrates 6000 times in a minute.

            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                Yes, sound follows the same laws of reflection as light. The laws of reflection for sound are:<br><br>
                1. The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection.<br>
                2. The incident sound wave, the reflected sound wave, and the normal to the reflecting surface at the point of incidence all lie in the same plane.<br><br>
                
                These are the same laws that govern the reflection of light.

                <span>When a sound is reflected from a distant object, an echo is produced. Let the distance between the reflecting surface and the source of sound production remains the same. Do you hear echo sound on a hotter day?</span>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                Yes, we can hear an echo on a hotter day, but the minimum distance required to hear a distinct echo may change. The speed of sound increases with temperature. At higher temperatures, sound travels faster, so it takes less time to cover the same distance. For a distinct echo, the time gap between the original sound and the reflected sound must be at least 0.1 seconds. Since sound travels faster on a hotter day, the minimum distance required to hear a distinct echo increases.

                Two practical applications of reflection of sound waves are:<br><br>

            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                We need to calculate two times:<br><br>
                
                1. Time taken by the stone to fall to the water:<br>
                Using s = ut + ½gt²<br>
                500 = 0 × t + ½ × 10 × t²<br>
                500 = 5t²<br>
                t² = 100<br>
                t = 10 seconds<br><br>
                
                2. Time taken by sound to travel from water surface to top of tower:<br>
                Time = Distance/Speed = 500/340 ≈ 1.47 seconds<br><br>
                
                Total time = 10 + 1.47 = 11.47 seconds<br><br>
                
                Therefore, the splash is heard at the top after approximately 11.47 seconds.

            <div class="answer">
                Given: Speed (v) = 339 m/s, Wavelength (λ) = 1.5 cm = 0.015 m<br><br>
                
                Using v = λν<br>
                339 = 0.015 × ν<br>
                ν = 339/0.015 = 22,600 Hz = 22.6 kHz<br><br>
                
                The audible range for humans is 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz (20 kHz).<br>

                2. <strong>Distance from the source:</strong> Loudness decreases as we move away from the source<br>
                3. <strong>Area of the vibrating body:</strong> Larger vibrating surfaces produce louder sounds<br>
                4. <strong>Sensitivity of the ear:</strong> Different people perceive loudness differently

                <span>How is ultrasound used for cleaning?</span>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                Ultrasound is used for cleaning in the following way:<br><br>
                
                1. Objects to be cleaned are placed in a cleaning solution.<br>
                2. Ultrasonic waves (high frequency sound waves above 20 kHz) are sent into the solution.<br>
                3. Due to the high frequency, the particles of dust, grease, and dirt get detached from the object.<br>
                4. These detached particles drop out of the object, resulting in thorough cleaning.<br><br>
                
                This method is particularly useful for cleaning parts located in hard-to-reach places, such as spiral tubes, odd-shaped parts, and electronic components.

                <span>Explain how defects in a metal block can be detected using ultrasound.</span>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                Ultrasound is used to detect defects in metal blocks as follows:<br><br>
                
                1. Ultrasonic waves are directed through the metal block.<br>
                2. Detectors are placed to receive the transmitted waves.<br>
                3. If there is a defect (crack or hole) inside the metal block, the ultrasound gets reflected back from that location.<br>
                4. The reflected waves are detected, indicating the presence and location of the flaw.<br><br>
                
                This technique is effective because ultrasound travels in well-defined paths and gets reflected from defects, whereas ordinary sound of longer wavelengths would bend around corners and not detect small defects.
