            <div class="answer">
                <p><strong>Given:</strong></p>
                <p>Diameter of circular track = 200 m</p>

                <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
                <p>Number of rounds completed in 140 s = 140 / 40 = 3.5 rounds</p>
                <p>Distance covered = 3.5 × circumference = 3.5 × 2πr = 3.5 × 2 × 3.14 × 100 = 2198 m</p>

            <div class="answer">
                <p>(a) Possible. Example: When a ball is thrown vertically upward, at the highest point its velocity is zero but acceleration due to gravity is constant (9.8 m/s² downward).</p>
                <p>(b) Possible. Example: Uniform circular motion - an object moving in a circle with constant speed has acceleration (centripetal acceleration) directed toward the center.</p>
                <p>(c) Possible. Example: In projectile motion, the horizontal velocity is constant while acceleration due to gravity acts vertically downward (perpendicular to horizontal motion).</p>
                <br>
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> All three situations are possible with the examples given above.</p>

                <span class="question-number">10</span>
                <span>An artificial satellite is moving in a circular orbit of radius 42250 km. Calculate its speed if it takes 24 hours to revolve around the earth.</span>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p><strong>Given:</strong></p>
                <p>Radius of orbit, r = 42250 km</p>
                <p>Time for one revolution, t = 24 hours</p>
                <br>
                <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
                <p>Distance covered in one revolution = Circumference of orbit = 2πr</p>
                <p>Distance = 2 × 3.14 × 42250 ≈ 265,330 km</p>
                <p>Speed = Distance/Time = 265,330 km / 24 h ≈ 11,055 km/h</p>
                <br>
                <p>In m/s: 11,055 km/h = 11,055 × 1000 / 3600 ≈ 3070.8 m/s</p>
                <br>
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> The speed of the satellite is approximately 11,055 km/h or 3070.8 m/s.</p>
