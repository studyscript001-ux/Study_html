                <span>An object thrown at a certain angle to the ground moves in a curved path and falls back to the ground. The initial and the final points of the path of the object lie on the same horizontal line. What is the work done by the force of gravity on the object?</span>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">The work done by gravity is zero. This is because the initial and final points are at the same height, so the net displacement in the direction of gravity is zero. Work done = force × displacement in the direction of force. Since displacement in the vertical direction is zero, work done by gravity is zero.</div>

            </div>
            <div class="answer">The work done by gravity is zero. This is because the gravitational force acts vertically downward, while the displacement is horizontal. Since the angle between force and displacement is 90°, work done = F × s × cos 90° = F × s × 0 = 0.</div>

            <div class="answer">No, this does not violate the law of conservation of energy. As the potential energy decreases, the kinetic energy increases by the same amount.

            </div>
            <div class="answer">The work done by gravity on a satellite moving around the Earth is zero.

            </div>
            <div class="answer">Yes, according to Newton's first law of motion, an object in motion will continue in motion with constant velocity in the absence of any net external force. So displacement can occur without any force acting on the object if it's already in motion.</div>

            <div class="answer">No, in the scientific sense, no work is done on the bundle of hay.

            <div class="answer">
                <strong>Energy changes in a pendulum:</strong><br>
                - At extreme position: Maximum potential energy, zero kinetic energy<br>
                - At mean position: Zero potential energy, maximum kinetic energy<br>
                - Throughout motion: Total mechanical energy (PE + KE) remains constant (in ideal conditions)<br><br>
                <strong>Why it comes to rest:</strong> Due to air resistance and friction at the pivot point, some mechanical energy is converted to heat and sound energy.<br><br>
                <strong>What happens to energy:</strong> The total energy is conserved but transformed from mechanical energy to heat and sound energy.<br><br>
                <strong>Violation of conservation?</strong> No, it's not a violation. The law of conservation of energy states that energy can neither be created nor destroyed, only transformed from one form to another.

                <span>Calculate the work required to be done to stop a car of 1500 kg moving at a velocity of 60 km/h.</span>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                Mass, m = 1500 kg<br>
                Velocity, v = 60 km/h = 60 × (1000/3600) m/s = 50/3 m/s ≈ 16.67 m/s<br>
                Work done = Change in kinetic energy = 0 - ½mv²<br>
                = -½ × 1500 × (50/3)² = -750 × (2500/9) = -750 × 277.78 ≈ -208,333.33 J<br>
                The work required to stop the car is approximately 208,333 J (or 208.33 kJ).

                <span>In each of the following a force, F is acting on an object of mass, m. The direction of displacement is from west to east shown by the longer arrow. Observe the diagrams carefully and state whether the work done by the force is negative, positive or zero.</span>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                Without the actual diagrams, we can state the general principles:<br>
                - Work is positive when force and displacement are in the same direction<br>
                - Work is negative when force and displacement are in opposite directions<br>
                - Work is zero when force is perpendicular to displacement

                <span>Soni says that the acceleration in an object could be zero even when several forces are acting on it. Do you agree with her? Why?</span>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">Yes, I agree with Soni. According to Newton's first law, if the net force on an object is zero, the acceleration will be zero, even if multiple forces are acting on it. This happens when all forces balance each other out (equal in magnitude and opposite in direction).</div>

                <span>Find the energy in joules consumed in 10 hours by four devices of power 500 W each.</span>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                Power of one device = 500 W<br>
                Total power of four devices = 4 × 500 W = 2000 W = 2 kW<br>
                Time = 10 hours<br>
                Energy consumed = Power × Time = 2 kW × 10 h = 20 kWh<br>
                1 kWh = 3.6 × 10⁶ J<br>
                20 kWh = 20 × 3.6 × 10⁶ J = 7.2 × 10⁷ J<br>
                The energy consumed is 7.2 × 10⁷ joules.

                <span>A freely falling object eventually stops on reaching the ground. What happens to its kinetic energy?</span>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">When a freely falling object hits the ground, its kinetic energy is transformed into other forms of energy:
                <ul>
                    <li>Sound energy (the sound of impact)</li>
                    <li>Heat energy (due to friction and deformation)</li>
                    <li>Potential energy of deformation (if the object or ground deforms)</li>
                </ul>
                The total energy is conserved according to the law of conservation of energy.
