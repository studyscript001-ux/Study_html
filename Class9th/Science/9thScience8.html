                <span>An object experiences a net zero external unbalanced force. Is it possible for the object to be travelling with a non-zero velocity? If yes, state the conditions that must be placed on the magnitude and direction of the velocity. If no, provide a reason.</span>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                Answer: Yes, it is possible. According to Newton's first law of motion, an object continues to be in a state of rest or of uniform motion along a straight line unless acted upon by an unbalanced force. So, if an object is already moving with a constant velocity (non-zero), and the net external force acting on it is zero, it will continue to move with the same velocity. The conditions are that the object must be moving with a constant velocity (constant speed and direction) in a straight line.

            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                Answer: This can be explained by the law of inertia. Initially, the carpet and the dust particles are at rest. When the carpet is beaten with a stick, the carpet moves but the dust particles tend to remain at rest due to inertia. As a result, the dust particles get separated from the carpet and come out.

            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                Answer: When a bus starts moving suddenly, the luggage tends to remain at rest due to inertia and might fall backward. Similarly, when the moving bus stops suddenly, the luggage tends to continue in motion and might fall forward. Tying the luggage with a rope prevents it from falling due to sudden starts or stops of the bus.

                <span>A batsman hits a cricket ball which then rolls on a level ground. After covering a short distance, the ball comes to rest. The ball slows to a stop because:<br>
                (a) the batsman did not hit the ball hard enough.<br>
                (b) velocity is proportional to the force exerted on the ball.<br>
                (c) there is a force on the ball opposing the motion.<br>

            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                Answer: (c) there is a force on the ball opposing the motion.<br>
                The ball comes to rest due to the frictional force acting between the ball and the ground, which opposes the motion of the ball.

                <span>A truck starts from rest and rolls down a hill with a constant acceleration. It travels a distance of 400 m in 20 s. Find its acceleration. Find the force acting on it if its mass is 7 tonnes (Hint: 1 tonne = 1000 kg).</span>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                Answer: <br>
                Given: Initial velocity (u) = 0 m/s, Distance (s) = 400 m, Time (t) = 20 s, Mass (m) = 7 tonnes = 7000 kg<br><br>
                
                Using the equation of motion: s = ut + ½at²<br>
                400 = 0 × 20 + ½ × a × (20)²<br>
                400 = 0 + ½ × a × 400<br>
                400 = 200a<br>
                a = 400/200 = 2 m/s²<br><br>
                
                Now, Force (F) = m × a = 7000 × 2 = 14000 N<br><br>
                
                Therefore, acceleration = 2 m/s² and force = 14000 N.

                <span>A stone of 1 kg is thrown with a velocity of 20 m s⁻¹ across the frozen surface of a lake and comes to rest after travelling a distance of 50 m. What is the force of friction between the stone and the ice?</span>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                Answer: <br>
                Given: Mass (m) = 1 kg, Initial velocity (u) = 20 m/s, Final velocity (v) = 0 m/s, Distance (s) = 50 m<br><br>
                
                Using the equation: v² = u² + 2as<br>
                0² = (20)² + 2 × a × 50<br>
                0 = 400 + 100a<br>
                100a = -400<br>
                a = -4 m/s² (negative sign indicates retardation)<br><br>
                
                Force of friction (F) = m × a = 1 × (-4) = -4 N<br><br>
                
                Therefore, the force of friction between the stone and ice is 4 N (opposing the motion).

                (a) the net accelerating force and<br>
                (b) the acceleration of the train.</span>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                Answer: <br>
                Mass of engine = 8000 kg<br>
                Mass of each wagon = 2000 kg<br>
                Number of wagons = 5<br>
                Total mass of wagons = 5 × 2000 = 10000 kg<br>
                Total mass of train = mass of engine + mass of wagons = 8000 + 10000 = 18000 kg<br><br>
                
                (a) Net accelerating force = Force exerted by engine - Frictional force<br>
                = 40000 N - 5000 N = 35000 N<br><br>
                
                (b) Using F = ma<br>
                35000 = 18000 × a<br>
                a = 35000/18000 = 1.944 m/s²<br><br>
                
                Therefore, net accelerating force = 35000 N and acceleration = 1.944 m/s².

            <div class="answer">
                Answer: <br>
                Given: Mass (m) = 1500 kg, Acceleration (a) = -1.7 m/s²<br><br>
                
                Force (F) = m × a = 1500 × (-1.7) = -2550 N<br><br>
                
                Therefore, the force between the vehicle and road is 2550 N in the direction opposite to the motion of the vehicle.

            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                Answer: When an object moves with constant velocity, the net force acting on it is zero (according to Newton's first law of motion). Therefore, the friction force opposing the motion must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the applied force. So, the friction force will be 200 N.

                <span>According to the third law of motion when we push on an object, the object pushes back on us with an equal and opposite force. If the object is a massive truck parked along the roadside, it will probably not move. A student justifies this by answering that the two opposite and equal forces cancel each other. Comment on this logic and explain why the truck does not move.</span>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                Answer: The student's logic is incorrect because the action and reaction forces act on different objects. When we push the truck, we apply a force on the truck (action). The truck applies an equal and opposite force on us (reaction). These two forces don't cancel each other because they act on different objects. The truck doesn't move because the force we apply is not enough to overcome the static friction between the truck's tires and the road, and possibly because of the truck's large mass which requires a large force to accelerate (according to F = ma).

                Initial velocity (u) = 150 m/s<br>
                Final velocity (v) = 0 m/s<br>
                Time (t) = 0.03 s<br><br>
                
                Acceleration (a) = (v - u)/t = (0 - 150)/0.03 = -5000 m/s²<br><br>
                
                Distance of penatration (s):<br>
                Using v² = u² + 2as<br>
                0² = (150)² + 2 × (-5000) × s<br>
                0 = 22500 - 10000s<br>
                10000s = 22500<br>
                s = 22500/10000 = 2.25 m<br><br>
                
                Force (F) = m × a = 0.01 × (-5000) = -50 N<br><br>
                
                Therefore, distance of penatration = 2.25 m and magnitude of force = 50 N.

            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                Answer: <br>
                Mass of object (m₁) = 1 kg, Initial velocity of object (u₁) = 10 m/s<br>
                Mass of block (m₂) = 5 kg, Initial velocity of block (u₂) = 0 m/s<br><br>
                
                Total momentum before impact = m₁u₁ + m₂u₂ = (1 × 10) + (5 × 0) = 10 kg m/s<br><br>
                
                According to the law of conservation of momentum:<br>
                Total momentum before impact = Total momentum after impact<br>
                So, total momentum after impact = 10 kg m/s<br><br>
                
                After collision, combined mass (M) = m₁ + m₂ = 1 + 5 = 6 kg<br>
                Let final velocity of combined object = v<br><br>
                
                Then, M × v = 10<br>
                6 × v = 10<br>
                v = 10/6 = 1.67 m/s<br><br>
                
                Therefore, total momentum before impact = 10 kg m/s, after impact = 10 kg m/s, and velocity of combined object = 1.67 m/s.

            <div class="answer">
                Answer: <br>
                Mass (m) = 100 kg<br>
                Initial velocity (u) = 5 m/s<br>
                Final velocity (v) = 8 m/s<br>
                Time (t) = 6 s<br><br>
                
                Initial momentum (p₁) = m × u = 100 × 5 = 500 kg m/s<br>
                Final momentum (p₂) = m × v = 100 × 8 = 800 kg m/s<br><br>
                
                Acceleration (a) = (v - u)/t = (8 - 5)/6 = 3/6 = 0.5 m/s²<br><br>
                
                Force (F) = m × a = 100 × 0.5 = 50 N<br><br>
                
                Therefore, initial momentum = 500 kg m/s, final momentum = 800 kg m/s, and force = 50 N.

                <span>Akhtar, Kiran and Rahul were riding in a motorcar that was moving with a high velocity on an expressway when an insect hit the windshield and got stuck on the windscreen. Akhtar and Kiran started pondering over the situation. Kiran suggested that the insect suffered a greater change in momentum as compared to the change in momentum of the motorcar (because the change in the velocity of the insect was much more than that of the motorcar). Akhtar said that since the motorcar was moving with a larger velocity, it exerted a larger force on the insect. And as a result the insect died. Rahul while putting an entirely new explanation said that both the motorcar and the insect experienced the same force and a change in their momentum. Comment on these suggestions.</span>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                Answer: According to Newton's third law of motion, when the insect hits the windshield, the insect exerts a force on the car and the car exerts an equal and opposite force on the insect. So, both experience the same magnitude of force.<br><br>
                
                However, the change in momentum is equal to the force multiplied by the time of impact (F × Δt). Since the time of impact is the same for both, the magnitude of change in momentum is the same for both the insect and the car.<br><br>
                
                But the effect of this change in momentum is different because of their different masses. For the car (with large mass), the change in velocity is very small, while for the insect (with small mass), the change in velocity is very large, which causes the death of the insect.<br><br>
                
                Therefore, Rahul's explanation is correct: both experienced the same force and the same change in momentum.

                <span>How much momentum will a dumb-bell of mass 10 kg transfer to the floor if it falls from a height of 80 cm? Take its downward acceleration to be 10 m s⁻².</span>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                Answer: <br>
                Mass (m) = 10 kg<br>
                Height (h) = 80 cm = 0.8 m<br>
                Acceleration due to gravity (g) = 10 m/s²<br>
                Initial velocity (u) = 0 m/s<br><br>
                
                Using v² = u² + 2gh<br>
                v² = 0² + 2 × 10 × 0.8<br>
                v² = 16<br>
                v = 4 m/s (velocity just before hitting the floor)<br><br>
                
                Momentum transferred to the floor = m × v = 10 × 4 = 40 kg m/s<br><br>
                
                Therefore, the dumb-bell will transfer 40 kg m/s of momentum to the floor.
