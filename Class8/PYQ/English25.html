                <div class="answer">The central idea of 'The Last Bargain' by Rabindranath Tagore is that true freedom and fulfillment cannot be bought with material wealth or power. The speaker in the poem rejects offers from a king, a rich man, and a beautiful woman, finding true liberation only when a child offers to hire him with nothing - representing the value of innocence, simplicity, and freedom from worldly attachments.</div>

                <div class="answer">When Bepin Babu discovered that Chunilal had tricked him, he likely felt a mixture of emotions - initially shock and disbelief, followed by anger and embarrassment. Having suffered mental anguish and confusion about his memory, he probably felt betrayed by his old friend. However, he might have also realized the lesson behind the trick - that he had been selfish and neglected his old friend in his time of need. This realization might have led to feelings of guilt and self-reflection about his behavior.</div>

                <div class="answer">
                    The mother tongue is the first language that the child learns and picks up from the people around him. A foreign language is a language that one uses for a limited purpose. The mother tongue comes in a natural way, whereas a foreign language is learned so that one may be able to write and speak it. A language is learned with its structure, grammar and vocabulary. The mother tongue may have a different structure, grammar and vocabulary. The mother tongue may have a different sentence structure. Often the method of translation is adopted for easy understanding of a foreign language. This is not a good way of learning a foreign language. So instead of learning a foreign language through translation one should learn the correct structure, grammar and vocabulary of the new language. The exposure to a language is also an important factor in learning.
