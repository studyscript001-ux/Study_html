            <div class="question">1. Which of the following cannot be charged easily by friction?</div>
            <div class="mcq-container">
                <div class="mcq-option">(a) A plastic scale</div>

            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <strong>Explanation:</strong> Metals like copper are good conductors of electricity. When we try to charge them by friction, the charges immediately flow to the ground through our body. Therefore, they cannot be charged easily by friction.

                <strong>Explanation:</strong> When a glass rod is rubbed with silk, the glass rod loses electrons and becomes positively charged, while the silk cloth gains electrons and becomes negatively charged.

            <div class="question">4. Sometimes, a crackling sound is heard while taking off a sweater during winters. Explain.</div>
            <div class="answer">
                The crackling sound is produced due to the discharge of static electricity. When we take off a sweater (especially woolen or synthetic), friction between the sweater and our body or other clothes causes the transfer of electrons, leading to the buildup of static charges. When these charges accumulate and then discharge, they create tiny sparks that produce the crackling sound.

            <div class="question">5. Explain why a charged body loses its charge if we touch it with our hand.</div>
            <div class="answer">
                When we touch a charged body with our hand, the electric charges transfer from the charged body to our body. Since our body is a conductor of electricity and is connected to the ground (earth), the charges flow through our body to the ground. This process is called earthing, and it causes the charged body to lose its charge.

            <div class="question">6. Name the scale on which the destructive energy of an earthquake is measured. An earthquake measures 3 on this scale. Would it be recorded by a seismograph? Is it likely to cause much damage?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                The destructive energy of an earthquake is measured on the <span class="highlight">Richter scale</span>. 
                <br><br>
                An earthquake measuring 3 on the Richter scale would be recorded by a seismograph, but it is considered a minor earthquake that is often felt by people but typically causes little to no damage. Earthquakes below magnitude 4.0 are generally not destructive.

                Three measures to protect ourselves from lightning:
                <ol>
                    <li>Seek shelter inside a building or vehicle during a thunderstorm</li>
                    <li>Avoid taking shelter under isolated tall trees, and instead squat low on the ground with hands on knees if caught in an open area</li>
                    <li>Avoid contact with electrical appliances, wired phones, and plumbing during a thunderstorm</li>
                </ol>
                Additional measures include unplugging electronic devices and staying away from windows and doors.

            <div class="question">8. Explain why a charged balloon is repelled by another charged balloon whereas an uncharged balloon is attracted by another charged balloon?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                When both balloons are charged with the same type of charge (usually negative when rubbed with wool), they repel each other because like charges repel. <br><br>
                An uncharged balloon is attracted to a charged balloon because the charged balloon induces opposite charges on the side of the uncharged balloon nearest to it. The attractive force between these opposite charges is stronger than the repulsive force between the similar charges on the far side.

            <div class="question">9. Describe with the help of a diagram an instrument which can be used to detect a charged body.</div>
            <div class="answer">
                An <span class="highlight">electroscope</span> is used to detect whether a body is charged or not. It consists of:
                <ul>
                    <li>A metal rod with a disc or ball at the top</li>
                    <li>Two thin leaves of gold or aluminum attached to the bottom of the rod</li>
                    <li>The rod is inserted in a flask with the leaves inside and the disc outside</li>
                </ul>

                </div>
                When a charged body is brought near the disc, charge is transferred through the rod to the leaves. Since both leaves receive the same charge, they repel each other and diverge. The extent of divergence indicates the amount of charge.

            <div class="question">12. The weather department has predicted that a thunderstorm is likely to occur on a certain day. Suppose you have to go out on that day. Would you carry an umbrella? Explain.</div>
            <div class="answer">
                No, I would not carry an umbrella if a thunderstorm is predicted. Here's why:
                <ul>
                    <li>An umbrella with a metal shaft can act as a lightning conductor, increasing the risk of being struck by lightning</li>
                    <li>Holding an umbrella makes me the tallest object in an open area, which is dangerous during lightning</li>
                    <li>It's safer to wear a raincoat or waterproof jacket instead</li>
                    <li>If possible, I would postpone my trip or find indoor shelter until the storm passes</li>
                </ul>
                Safety during a thunderstorm involves avoiding being the highest point in an area and staying away from metal objects.

        <strong>Safety Note:</strong> Always follow safety guidelines during natural phenomena like thunderstorms and earthquakes. Stay informed about weather alerts and have an emergency plan ready.
