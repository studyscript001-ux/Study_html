                    <p class="question">Give reasons.</p>
                    <div class="answer">
                        <p><strong>(a) Water is not used to control fires involving electrical equipment.</strong></p>
                        <p>Water is a good conductor of electricity. If it is used on electrical fires, it can conduct electricity and harm the people trying to extinguish the fire.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>(b) LPG is a better domestic fuel than wood.</strong></p>
                        <p>LPG is a better fuel because it is readily available and burns easily. It produces a large amount of heat, has a high calorific value, and does not produce gases or residues that pollute the environment.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>(c) Paper by itself catches fire easily whereas a piece of paper wrapped around an aluminium pipe does not.</strong></p>
                        <p>Paper has a very low ignition temperature and catches fire easily. When it is wrapped around an aluminium pipe, the aluminium absorbs the heat. This prevents the paper from reaching its ignition temperature, so it does not burn.</p>

                    <div class="answer">
                        <p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is an excellent fire extinguisher because it is heavier than oxygen. It covers the fire like a blanket, cutting off the contact between the fuel and oxygen, which is essential for combustion. Additionally, when released from a cylinder, it expands and cools down, which helps to bring down the temperature of the fuel.</p>

                    <div class="answer">
                        <p>It is difficult to burn green leaves because they contain water, which raises their ignition temperature. The water needs to evaporate before the leaves can reach the temperature required to burn. Dry leaves, on the other hand, have no water content, so they can easily reach their ignition temperature and catch fire.</p>

                    <div class="answer">
                        <p>A goldsmith uses the outermost zone of the flame to melt gold and silver. This is because the outermost zone is the hottest part of the flame due to complete combustion.</p>

                    <p class="question">In an experiment 4.5 kg of a fuel was completely burnt. The heat produced was measured to be 1,80,000 kJ. Calculate the calorific value of the fuel.</p>
                    <div class="answer">
                        <p>The calorific value is calculated by dividing the total heat produced by the mass of the fuel.</p>
                        <div class="calculation">
                            <p>Calorific Value = (Total Heat Produced) / (Mass of Fuel)</p>
                            <p>Calorific Value = 1,80,000 kJ / 4.5 kg</p>
                            <p>Calorific Value = 40,000 kJ/kg</p>

                    <p class="question">Can the process of rusting be called combustion? Discuss.</p>
                    <div class="answer">
                        <p>The process of rusting can be called slow combustion. Both rusting and combustion are chemical processes where a substance reacts with oxygen. However, in combustion, heat and light are produced rapidly, whereas rusting is a very slow process where the heat produced is barely noticeable.</p>

                    <p class="question">Abida and Ramesh were doing an experiment in which water was to be heated in a beaker. Abida kept the beaker near the wick in the yellow part of the candle flame. Ramesh kept the beaker in the outermost part of the flame. Whose water will get heated in a shorter time?</p>
                    <div class="answer">
                        <p>Ramesh's water will get heated in a shorter time. The outermost zone of the candle flame where Ramesh placed his beaker is the hottest part of the flame because of complete combustion. The yellow part of the flame where Abida placed her beaker is the middle zone, which is only moderately hot due to partial combustion.</p>
