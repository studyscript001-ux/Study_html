            <div class="question">1. Suppose you are in a dark room. Can you see objects in the room? Can you see objects outside the room? Explain.</div>
            <div class="answer">
                In a dark room, I cannot see objects inside the room because there is no light to reflect from these objects to my eyes. However, if there is light outside the room (like sunlight or artificial light), I might be able to see objects outside through a window or opening, as light from those objects can reach my eyes.

        <div class="content">
            <div class="question">2. Differentiate between regular and diffused reflection. Does diffused reflection mean the failure of the laws of reflection?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <strong>Regular Reflection:</strong> Occurs when light reflects from a smooth, polished surface like a mirror. The reflected rays are parallel and form a clear image.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Diffused Reflection:</strong> Occurs when light reflects from a rough or irregular surface. The reflected rays scatter in different directions, and no clear image is formed.
                <br><br>
                Diffused reflection does not mean the failure of the laws of reflection. At each point on the rough surface, the laws of reflection are still obeyed (angle of incidence equals angle of reflection). However, because the surface is uneven, the normals at different points face different directions, causing the reflected rays to scatter.

                <ol>
                    <li>Take three rectangular mirror strips (about 15 cm long and 4 cm wide).</li>
                    <li>Join them together to form a triangular prism (mirrored surfaces facing inward).</li>
                    <li>Fix this mirror arrangement inside a cardboard tube slightly longer than the mirrors.</li>
                    <li>Close one end of the tube with a cardboard disc having a small hole in the center for viewing.</li>
                    <li>At the other end, place a circular glass plate touching the mirrors.</li>
                    <li>Put small pieces of colored glass or beads on this glass plate.</li>

                <p>The human eye is a complex optical instrument that works similarly to a camera. Light enters through the cornea, passes through the pupil (whose size is controlled by the iris), and is focused by the lens onto the retina. The retina contains photoreceptor cells (rods and cones) that convert light into electrical signals, which are then transmitted to the brain via the optic nerve.</p>

            <div class="answer">
                The teacher advised against using a laser torch because lasers can be harmful to eyes. Laser light is highly concentrated and can cause permanent damage to the retina if shone directly into someone's eyes. Even brief exposure to laser light can potentially cause vision problems or blindness. Regular torch light is much safer for such activities.

            <div class="question">13. What is the angle of incidence of a ray if the reflected ray is at an angle of 90° to the incident ray?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                According to the law of reflection, angle of incidence = angle of reflection.
                <br><br>
                If the angle between the incident ray and reflected ray is 90°, then:
                <br>
                Angle of incidence + Angle of reflection = 90°
                <br>
                Since angle of incidence = angle of reflection,
                <br>
                2 × Angle of incidence = 90°
                <br>
                Therefore, Angle of incidence = 45°

            <div class="answer">
                When an object is placed between two parallel mirrors, theoretically, an infinite number of images are formed. This happens because each image in one mirror acts as an object for the other mirror, creating a series of reflections that continue endlessly. In practice, the images become progressively dimmer and eventually become too faint to see.

            <div class="answer">
                <strong>Solution:</strong>
                <ol>
                    <li>The first reflection: Angle of incidence = 30°, so angle of reflection = 30°</li>
                    <li>This reflected ray will hit the second mirror at an angle of 60° (90° - 30° = 60°)</li>
                    <li>For the second mirror: Angle of incidence = 60°, so angle of reflection = 60°</li>
                    <li>The final reflected ray will make an angle of 60° with the second mirror</li>

                The reflected ray from the second mirror will be parallel to the original incident ray but in the opposite direction.

            <div class="answer">
                <strong>Boojho at A:</strong> He cannot see himself in the mirror because he is positioned outside the field of view of the mirror. His position is such that light from himself cannot reach the mirror and reflect back to his eyes.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Objects at P, Q, and R:</strong>

                <strong>(a)</strong> The image of object at A will be formed behind the mirror at the same distance as object A is in front of the mirror. If we measure the perpendicular distance from A to the mirror, the image will be at an equal distance behind the mirror.
