                <div class="question">1. Why were people dissatisfied with British rule in the 1870s and 1880s?</div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>People were dissatisfied with British rule in the 1870s and 1880s for several key reasons:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Oppressive Acts:</strong> The British passed laws that angered the Indian people. The <strong>Arms Act of 1878</strong> prevented Indians from possessing arms, and the <strong>Vernacular Press Act of 1878</strong> was designed to silence newspapers that were critical of the government.</li>
                        <li><strong>Racial Discrimination:</strong> The controversy over the <strong>Ilbert Bill in 1883</strong> highlighted the deep-seated racial prejudice of the British. The bill tried to create equality between Indian and British judges, but it was withdrawn after strong opposition from the white community, enraging Indians.</li>
                        <li><strong>Growing Awareness:</strong> There was a growing consciousness that the British were controlling India's resources and the lives of its people for their own benefit, and that India could not truly belong to Indians until this control ended.</li>
                    </ul>

                <div class="question">2. Who did the Indian National Congress wish to speak for?</div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>The Indian National Congress wished to speak for <strong>all the people of India</strong>, irrespective of their class, colour, caste, community, language, or gender. </p>
                    <p>The leaders of the early political associations, including the Congress, made it clear that their goals were for the entire nation. As Badruddin Tyabji declared in 1887, the Congress was composed of representatives "not of any one class or community of India, but of all the different communities of India."</p>

                <div class="question">3. What economic impact did the First World War have on India?</div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>The First World War had a significant and mixed economic impact on India:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Increased Taxes:</strong> The war led to a huge increase in the defence expenditure of the British Indian government. To meet these costs, they increased taxes on individual incomes and business profits.</li>
                        <li><strong>Rise in Prices:</strong> Increased military spending and demand for war supplies caused a sharp rise in prices, which created great difficulties for the common people.</li>
                        <li><strong>Profits for Businesses:</strong> On the other hand, Indian business groups made huge profits. The war created a high demand for industrial goods like jute bags, cloth, and rails.</li>
                        <li><strong>Expansion of Indian Industries:</strong> Since imports from other countries declined during the war, Indian industries had an opportunity to expand.</li>

                <div class="answer">
                    <p>The Muslim League resolution of 1940 asked for <strong>‚ÄúIndependent States‚Äù for Muslims</strong> in the north-western and eastern areas of the country.</p>
                    <p>It's important to note that the resolution at this stage did not specifically mention the word "partition" or "Pakistan." It asked for an autonomous arrangement for the Muslims of the subcontinent.</p>

                <div class="question">5. Who were the Moderates? How did they propose to struggle against British rule?</div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>The <strong>Moderates</strong> were the leaders of the Indian National Congress in its first twenty years (1885-1905). They were "moderate" in their objectives and methods.</p>
                    <p>Their proposed methods of struggle were:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Public Awareness:</strong> They aimed to create public awareness about the unjust nature of British rule. They did this by publishing newspapers, writing articles, and giving speeches criticising British policies.</li>
                        <li><strong>Petitions and Resolutions:</strong> They believed in submitting petitions and passing resolutions to make the government aware of the feelings and demands of the Indian people.</li>
                        <li><strong>Appealing to British Justice:</strong> They felt that the British had respect for the ideals of freedom and justice. They believed that if the just demands of Indians were presented to the government properly, the British would accept them.</li>

                <div class="answer">
                    <p>The politics of the Radicals were significantly different from that of the Moderates:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Methods:</strong> Radicals, like Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Bepin Chandra Pal, and Lala Lajpat Rai, criticised the Moderates for their "politics of prayers" (i.e., petitions and appeals). Radicals advocated for more assertive methods like <strong>mass mobilisation and boycott</strong> of British institutions and goods.</li>
                        <li><strong>Philosophy:</strong> Radicals emphasised the importance of <strong>self-reliance and constructive work</strong>. They argued that people must rely on their own strength, not on the good intentions of the British government.</li>
                        <li><strong>Goal:</strong> The Radicals had a clearer and more forceful demand for self-rule. As Tilak famously declared, <strong>‚ÄúFreedom is my birthright and I shall have it!‚Äù</strong></li>

                <div class="question">7. Discuss the various forms that the Non-Cooperation Movement took in different parts of India. How did the people understand Gandhiji?</div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>The Non-Cooperation Movement (1920-22) took various forms across India as different groups interpreted Gandhiji's call in their own way, linking it to their local problems:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>In Kheda, Gujarat:</strong> Patidar peasants organised non-violent campaigns against high land revenue demands.</li>
                        <li><strong>In Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu:</strong> Liquor shops were picketed. In Guntur, tribals and poor peasants staged "forest satyagrahas" by sending their cattle into forests without paying grazing fees.</li>
                        <li><strong>In Punjab:</strong> The Akali agitation of the Sikhs to remove corrupt, British-supported *mahants* from their gurdwaras became closely identified with the movement.</li>
                        <li><strong>In Assam:</strong> Tea garden labourers, shouting "Gandhi Maharaj ki Jai", demanded better wages and left British-owned plantations.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>People's understanding of Gandhiji</strong> was varied. They often saw him as a messiah or a divine figure who could solve all their problems. Peasants believed he would help them fight against zamindars, and labourers believed he would get them land. They sometimes took actions in his name that did not align with his ideals of non-violence and class unity.</p>

            <div class="card discuss-card">
                <div class="question">8. Why did Gandhiji choose to break the salt law?</div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>Gandhiji chose to break the salt law in 1930 for very strategic reasons:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Unifying Issue:</strong> The British government had a monopoly on the manufacture and sale of salt and imposed a tax on it. Salt was an essential item in every Indian household's food, used by both the rich and the poor. A tax on salt was therefore a grievance shared by everyone.</li>
                        <li><strong>Symbol of Injustice:</strong> Gandhiji felt it was "sinful" to tax salt. By attacking this law, he could connect the abstract idea of freedom (*Swaraj*) to a concrete and deeply felt injustice.</li>
                        <li><strong>Mass Mobilisation:</strong> This issue had the power to mobilise millions of people across the country in a shared struggle against British rule, which is exactly what the Dandi March and the Civil Disobedience Movement achieved. </li>

                <div class="question">9. Discuss those developments of the 1937‚Äì47 period that led to the creation of Pakistan.</div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>Several key developments in the decade from 1937 to 1947 led to the creation of Pakistan:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>1937 Provincial Elections:</strong> The Muslim League was convinced that Muslims were a minority and would always have to play a secondary role in any democratic structure. The Congress's refusal to form a joint government with the League in the United Provinces in 1937 also annoyed the League.</li>
                        <li><strong>Widening Support for the League:</strong> The Congress was unable to mobilise Muslim masses in the 1930s, which allowed the League to expand its social support, especially when Congress leaders were jailed in the early 1940s.</li>
                        <li><strong>Failed Negotiations (1945):</strong> After World War II, talks between the British, the Congress, and the League failed. The League insisted it was the sole spokesperson for India‚Äôs Muslims, a claim the Congress, with its large Muslim membership, could not accept.</li>
                        <li><strong>1946 Elections:</strong> The League won a spectacular victory in the seats reserved for Muslims. This strengthened its demand for Pakistan.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cabinet Mission Failure:</strong> In March 1946, a British mission suggested that India remain united but with autonomy for Muslim-majority areas. It failed to get both parties to agree. Partition now seemed inevitable.</li>
                        <li><strong>"Direct Action Day":</strong> After the mission's failure, the League called for "Direct Action Day" on 16 August 1946 to win its demand for Pakistan. This led to widespread riots and violence, especially in Calcutta, making reconciliation impossible.</li>

                <div class="answer">
                    <p>This is an excellent opportunity to learn more about the diverse leaders of India's freedom struggle. Here are two examples to get you started:</p>
                    <p><strong>1. Sarojini Naidu (1879-1949):</strong> Known as the "Nightingale of India" for her poetry, Sarojini Naidu was a powerful leader and activist. She was deeply involved in the national movement from the 1920s. She was a significant leader of the Dandi March and was the first Indian woman to become the President of the Indian National Congress in 1925. She constantly fought for women's rights and their participation in the freedom struggle.</p>
                    <p><strong>2. Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan (1890-1988):</strong> Popularly known as "Badshah Khan" or the "Frontier Gandhi," he was a Pashtun leader from the North-West Frontier Province. He was a devout Muslim and a firm believer in Gandhiji's principle of non-violence. He founded the Khudai Khidmatgars ("Servants of God"), a powerful non-violent movement among the Pathans. He was strongly opposed to the Partition of India and criticised his Congress colleagues for agreeing to it. </p>
