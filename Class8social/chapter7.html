                            <p>(a) When the British captured Bengal, they framed many new laws to regulate the rules regarding marriage, adoption, inheritance of property, etc.</p>
                            <p><span class="false true-false">False.</span> The chapter indicates that initially, the British were hesitant to interfere with local customs. Laws like the ban on Sati (1829) and permitting widow remarriage (1856) were passed much later, often after extensive campaigning by Indian reformers.</p>

                            <p><span class="false true-false">False.</span> Many reformers, like Rammohun Roy and Ishwarchandra Vidyasagar, did the opposite. They used their knowledge of ancient texts to find verses that supported their point of view, arguing that current harmful practices were against the original traditions.</p>

                <div class="question">3. How did the knowledge of ancient texts help the reformers promote new laws?</div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>Knowledge of ancient texts was a powerful tool for reformers. Here’s how they used it:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Provided Legitimacy:</strong> Reformers like Rammohun Roy and Vidyasagar used ancient sacred texts to show that harmful practices like Sati or the ban on widow remarriage had no sanction in the original scriptures.</li>
                        <li><strong>Countered Orthodox Arguments:</strong> When conservative groups claimed that these practices were part of their religion, reformers could counter them by quoting verses from the same texts.</li>
                        <li><strong>Persuaded the Public:</strong> This strategy made their arguments more acceptable to the general public, who deeply respected these texts. They suggested that society had strayed from its purer, earlier traditions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Influenced British Officials:</strong> The British were more willing to pass new laws when they saw that the reforms were supported by learned Indians who could justify the changes based on the country's own ancient traditions. </li>

                <div class="question">4. What were the different reasons people had for not sending girls to school?</div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>In the nineteenth century, many people were afraid of sending girls to school for several reasons:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Fear of Neglecting Domestic Duties:</strong> They feared that schools would take girls away from home and prevent them from learning and performing their domestic duties.</li>
                        <li><strong>Fear of Corrupting Influence:</strong> They believed that girls had to travel through public places to get to school, which would have a corrupting influence on them. They felt girls should stay away from public spaces.</li>
                        <li><strong>Superstition:</strong> In many parts of the country, there was a widespread belief that if a woman was educated, she would become a widow.</li>

                <div class="answer">
                    <p><strong>Christian missionaries were attacked</strong> by many people because they were seen as a threat to Indian culture and religion. Their direct criticism of local customs and their efforts to convert people were viewed with suspicion and hostility.</p>
                    <p><strong>However, some people would have supported them too</strong>, for the following reasons:</p>
                     <ul>
                        <li><strong>Education Opportunities:</strong> During the nineteenth century, Christian missionaries were among the first to set up schools for tribal groups and "lower-caste" children.</li>
                        <li><strong>Empowerment for Marginalized Groups:</strong> For people from lower castes who faced daily humiliation and oppression, the missionaries' schools offered resources and a chance to escape the rigid caste system and improve their social standing.</li>

                <div class="answer">
                    <p>The British period brought several new opportunities for people from "low" castes, allowing them a chance to escape the oppressive village system:</p>
                     <ul>
                        <li><strong>Jobs in Cities:</strong> As new cities grew, there was a huge demand for labour to dig drains, lay roads, and construct buildings. Many poor people from low castes moved to cities for these jobs as coolies, diggers, sweepers, etc.</li>
                        <li><strong>Work in Plantations:</strong> Some went to work in plantations in Assam, Mauritius, Trinidad, and Indonesia. Though the work was hard, it was an opportunity to get away from the hold of upper-caste landowners.</li>
                        <li><strong>Factory Work:</strong> New factories and mills coming up in cities needed workers, providing another avenue for employment.</li>
                        <li><strong>Army Jobs:</strong> The British army offered opportunities. For example, a number of people from the Mahar caste, who were considered untouchable, found jobs in the Mahar Regiment.</li>

                <div class="question">7. How did Jyotirao Phule and other reformers justify their criticism of caste inequality in society?</div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>Jyotirao Phule and other reformers from non-Brahman backgrounds justified their criticism of caste inequality with powerful arguments:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Challenging the Aryan Theory:</strong> Phule argued that Brahmans were not the original inhabitants of the land. He claimed they were "Aryans" who came from outside, defeated the true children of the country (the so-called low castes), and established their dominance. Therefore, the upper castes had no right to their land and power.</li>
                        <li><strong>Vision of a "Golden Age":</strong> Phule spoke of a pre-Aryan "golden age" when warrior-peasants ruled the countryside in a just and fair manner. He urged the Shudras (labouring castes) and Ati-Shudras (untouchables) to unite and reclaim their rights. </li>
                        <li><strong>Universal Humanism:</strong> Reformers like Shri Narayana Guru argued that all humankind belonged to the same caste. His famous statement was "one caste, one religion, one god for humankind."</li>
                        <li><strong>Questioning Religious Texts:</strong> Leaders like Haridas Thakur and Periyar questioned Brahmanical texts that supported the caste system, arguing they were tools of oppression.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="question">8. Why did Phule dedicate his book Gulamgiri to the American movement to free slaves?</div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>Jyotirao Phule wrote his book <em>Gulamgiri</em> (meaning Slavery) in 1873. He dedicated it to all those Americans who had fought to free slaves because he wanted to <strong>establish a link between the conditions of the "lower" castes in India and the black slaves in America.</strong></p>
                    <p>By doing this, he was highlighting that the oppression and dehumanisation faced by both groups were similar. He expanded his criticism of the caste system to argue against all forms of inequality, showing that the struggle for justice was a global one.</p>

                <div class="question">9. What did Ambedkar want to achieve through the temple entry movement?</div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>Dr. B.R. Ambedkar started the temple entry movement between 1927 and 1935. His primary aim was not just about gaining entry into temples. He wanted to achieve a much larger social goal:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>His main aim was to <strong>make everyone see the power of caste prejudices within society.</strong></li>
                        <li>By challenging the ban on Dalits entering temples and using temple water, he was directly attacking the core ideas of untouchability and pollution that were upheld by Brahman priests and orthodox Hindus.</li>
                        <li>As he said in 1927, "We now want to go to the Tank only to prove that like others, we are also human beings." The movement was a powerful way to assert the rights and dignity of Dalits and demand social equality. </li>

                    <p><strong>Jyotirao Phule and E.V. Ramaswamy Naicker (Periyar) were critical of the national movement</strong> because they felt it was dominated by upper-caste leaders who were not truly concerned about the oppression faced by lower castes.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Phule wrote that upper-caste leaders preached unity only to serve their own purposes, and once freedom was achieved, the old caste hierarchy ("me here and you over there again") would return.</li>
                        <li>Periyar left the Congress party in disgust after seeing caste discrimination being practiced at a feast organized by nationalists. He felt untouchables had to fight for their own dignity.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Yes, their criticism did help the national struggle in an important way.</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Their forceful arguments led to rethinking and self-criticism among upper-caste nationalist leaders.</li>
                        <li>It forced the national movement to become more inclusive and address the issues of social inequality, not just political freedom from the British.</li>
                        <li>This pressure helped ensure that the vision of a free India would be one based on the principles of equality and justice for all citizens, which eventually became a cornerstone of the Indian Constitution.</li>
                    </ul>
