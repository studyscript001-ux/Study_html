                <div class="answer">
                    <p>William Jones, along with other Orientalists like Henry Colebrooke, felt the need to study Indian texts for several reasons:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Deep Respect for Ancient Cultures:</strong> Jones had a deep respect for ancient Indian civilisation, which he believed had attained its glory in the past.</li>
                        <li><strong>To Understand India:</strong> He felt that to truly understand India, it was essential to discover the sacred and legal texts (like those on law, philosophy, and religion) that were produced in the ancient period.</li>
                        <li><strong>Basis for Administration:</strong> He believed that only a study of these ancient texts could reveal the real ideas and laws of Hindus and Muslims, which would then form a solid basis for British administration in India.</li>
                        <li><strong>A Dual Mission:</strong> Jones thought this project would not only help the British learn from Indian culture but also help Indians rediscover their own lost heritage and past glories.</li>

                <div class="question">4. Why did James Mill and Thomas Macaulay think that European education was essential in India?</div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>James Mill and Thomas Macaulay were strong critics of Oriental learning and championed European education for the following reasons:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Superiority of Western Knowledge:</strong> They believed that the knowledge of the East was "full of errors and unscientific thought." Macaulay famously claimed that "a single shelf of a good European library was worth the whole native literature of India and Arabia."</li>
                        <li><strong>Education for Practical Use:</strong> They argued that education should be practical and useful. They felt that Indians should be taught about the scientific and technical advances of the West, not the poetry and sacred literature of the Orient.</li>
                        <li><strong>A "Civilising" Mission:</strong> Macaulay saw India as an uncivilised country that needed to be civilised. He believed that teaching English would be a way to change the tastes, values, and culture of the people.</li>
                        <li><strong>Creating Useful Subjects:</strong> Wood's Despatch later added that European learning would improve the moral character of Indians, making them truthful and honest, thus supplying the Company with trustworthy civil servants. It would also create a demand for British goods.</li>

                <div class="question">5. Why did Mahatma Gandhi want to teach children handicrafts?</div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>Mahatma Gandhi strongly advocated for teaching handicrafts as a central part of education because he believed:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Education is More than Literacy:</strong> He argued that true education was an "all-round drawing out of the best in child and man - body, mind and spirit," and literacy alone was not education.</li>
                        <li><strong>Develops the Mind and Soul:</strong> He felt that learning a craft and working with one's hands would develop a person's mind and their capacity to understand. It connects theoretical knowledge with practical, lived experience.</li>
                        <li><strong>Scientific Learning:</strong> He wanted handicrafts to be taught scientifically, so that the child would know the "why and the wherefore of every process." This would promote a deeper, more practical understanding of the world.</li>
                        <li><strong>Self-Reliance:</strong> Teaching a useful craft would enable children to produce from the very beginning of their training, making them self-reliant.</li>

                <div class="question">6. Why did Mahatma Gandhi think that English education had enslaved Indians?</div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>Mahatma Gandhi was highly critical of English education and believed it had enslaved Indians in several ways:</p>
                     <ul>
                        <li><strong>Created a Sense of Inferiority:</strong> He argued that it made Indians see Western civilisation as superior and destroyed the pride they had in their own culture.</li>
                        <li><strong>Made them Admirers of British Rule:</strong> Charmed by the West, Indians educated in these institutions began admiring the British and their rule, instead of questioning it.</li>
                        <li><strong>Distanced them from the Masses:</strong> Education in English, a foreign language, distanced the educated from their own social surroundings. They became "strangers in their own lands," unable to relate to the common people.</li>
                        <li><strong>Valued the Wrong Things:</strong> He felt that this education focused on textbooks rather than practical knowledge and lived experience, which crippled the natural development of Indians.</li>

                     <ul>
                        <li><strong>Check the School's Website or Diary:</strong> Often, the "About Us" section of a school's website or the first few pages of the school diary has a brief history.</li>
                        <li><strong>Talk to Senior Teachers or the Principal:</strong> Teachers who have been at the school for a long time, or the Principal, might know a lot about its history.</li>
                        <li><strong>Look for Foundation Stones:</strong> Check the school buildings for a foundation stone. It usually has the year the school was established and the name of the person who inaugurated it.</li>
                        <li><strong>Find Old School Magazines:</strong> The school library might have old copies of school magazines, which are a treasure trove of information about the past.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Try to find out: When was it founded? Who founded it? What was its original purpose? How has it changed over the years?</p>
