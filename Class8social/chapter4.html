                <div class="question">3. What problems did shifting cultivators face under British rule?</div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>Shifting cultivators (or jhum cultivators) faced several serious problems under British rule:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Loss of Land:</strong> The British introduced land settlements to get a regular revenue. They measured the land and gave ownership rights to some, making others tenants. This disrupted the traditional system where land often belonged to the whole clan.</li>
                        <li><strong>Restrictions on Movement:</strong> The British were uncomfortable with groups that moved around. They wanted them to settle down and become peasant cultivators, as settled people were easier to control and administer. This went against the very nature of shifting cultivation.</li>
                        <li><strong>Forest Laws:</strong> The British declared forests as state property and reserved large areas. Shifting cultivators were banned from practising their traditional cultivation in these Reserved Forests.</li>
                        <li><strong>Unsuccessful Settled Cultivation:</strong> The British effort to make them take up settled plough cultivation often failed. Jhum cultivators' fields did not produce good yields in dry areas with scarce water, leading to suffering.</li>

                <div class="question">4. How did the powers of tribal chiefs change under colonial rule?</div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>The powers and authority of tribal chiefs changed completely under colonial rule. Before the British, they were powerful figures, but afterwards:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Loss of Administrative Power:</strong> They lost most of their administrative powers and were forced to follow laws made by British officials. They could no longer manage their territories and police their areas as they did before.</li>
                        <li><strong>Forced to Pay Tribute:</strong> They had to pay tribute (a form of tax or gift) to the British.</li>
                        <li><strong>Became Agents of the British:</strong> They were expected to discipline their own people on behalf of the British.</li>
                        <li><strong>Loss of Authority:</strong> As a result, they lost the authority and respect they had once enjoyed amongst their people and were unable to fulfill their traditional functions. While they were allowed to keep their land titles, they were chiefs only in name.</li>

             <div class="card discuss-card">
                <div class="question">5. What accounts for the anger of the tribals against the dikus?</div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>The term "dikus" meant outsiders, and the tribals were angry with them for several reasons, as these outsiders were seen as the cause of their misery:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Moneylenders (Dikus):</strong> They gave loans to tribals at very high interest rates. This trapped the tribals in a cycle of debt and poverty, often leading to them losing their land.</li>
                        <li><strong>Traders (Dikus):</strong> They came into the forests and bought forest produce at very cheap rates. For example, silk traders paid very little to the Santhal cocoon growers but sold the cocoons at huge profits.</li>
                        <li><strong>Landlords and the British Government (Dikus):</strong> The new land policies of the British were destroying the traditional land system of the tribals. Hindu landlords and moneylenders were taking over their land, which the tribals had cultivated for generations.</li>
                    </ul>
                     <p>Essentially, the tribals saw the dikusâ€”traders, moneylenders, landlords, missionaries, and the colonial governmentâ€”as the forces that were destroying their way of life, taking their land, and forcing them into debt.</p>

                <div class="question">6. What was Birsaâ€™s vision of a golden age? Why do you think such a vision appealed to the people of the region?</div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>Birsa Munda's vision was to bring back a glorious past, which he called a "golden age" or <strong>satyug (the age of truth)</strong>. In this golden age:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The Munda people would live an honest and good life, free from the oppression of dikus.</li>
                        <li>They would not kill their relatives and brethren.</li>
                        <li>They would construct embankments, tap natural springs, plant trees and orchards, and practise cultivation to earn their living.</li>
                        <li>They would work on their own land and be the masters of their own destiny.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>This vision appealed to the people because:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It reminded them of a better past before their lives were turned upside down by forest laws, traders, and moneylenders.</li>
                        <li>Their familiar ways of life were disappearing, and their livelihoods were under threat. Birsa's vision gave them hope for a future free from suffering, debt, and outside control.</li>
                        <li>It was a call to restore their dignity and their ancestral rights to their land, which they felt were being taken away from them.</li>

                <div class="answer">
                    <p>This is an activity for you to explore. The chapter itself mentions some revolts like the Santhal revolt (1855), the Bastar Rebellion (1910) and the Warli Revolt (1940). Here is a famous example you can research:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Alluri Sitarama Raju:</strong> He was a hero who led the Rampa Rebellion of 1922 in the tribal areas of Andhra Pradesh. The tribals were angry about the British forest laws that stopped them from practising their traditional 'podu' (shifting) cultivation. Alluri Raju, though not a tribal himself, organised the tribals to fight against the British. He was inspired by Mahatma Gandhi's ideas but believed that India could be liberated only by using force. He and his followers attacked police stations and fought a guerrilla war for two years before he was captured and executed in 1924. He is still remembered as a hero by the people. </li>

                    <p>This is a research activity. You can choose any tribal group mentioned in the chapter's map (like the <strong>Santhals, Gonds, Bhils, Khasis</strong>) or one from your own state.</p>
                    <p>Hereâ€™s how you can approach it:</p>
                     <ul>
                        <li><strong>Choose a Tribe:</strong> Let's say you choose the <strong>Santhal tribe</strong>, who live mainly in Jharkhand, West Bengal, and Odisha.</li>
                        <li><strong>Customs and Way of Life:</strong> Research their main festivals (like Sohrai), their traditional occupations (farming, art), their social structure, their music and dance forms (like Santhali dance), and their unique art style.</li>
                        <li><strong>Changes in the Last 50 Years:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Education:</strong> Find out how access to modern education has changed their lives. Many Santhals are now doctors, engineers, and government officers.</li>
                                <li><strong>Livelihood:</strong> While many still practice agriculture, others now work in cities, mines, and factories.
                                <li><strong>Challenges:</strong> They still face challenges like loss of land due to mining and industrial projects, and the struggle to preserve their language (Santali) and culture in a fast-changing world.</li>
                            </ul>
