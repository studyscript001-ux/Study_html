                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>High-Quality Goods:</strong> There was a big market in Europe for the fine qualities of cotton and silk produced in India.</li>
                        <li><strong>Demand for Spices:</strong> Indian spices like pepper, cloves, cardamom, and cinnamon were in great demand in Europe.</li>
                        <li><strong>Profit Margin:</strong> The companies could buy these goods at a cheap price in India and sell them at very high prices in Europe, which led to enormous profits. The goal was to "buy cheap and sell dear."</li>

                <div class="answer">
                    <p>The conflict between the Bengal nawabs and the East India Company grew in the early eighteenth century due to several issues:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Nawabs' Perspective:</strong>
                           <ul>
                               <li>The Nawabs, like Murshid Quli Khan and Sirajuddaulah, accused the Company of deceit.</li>
                               <li>They claimed the Company was depriving Bengal of huge amounts of revenue by refusing to pay taxes on its private trade.</li>
                               <li>They said the Company was undermining their authority by writing disrespectful letters and extending fortifications without permission.</li>
                           </ul>
                        </li>

                           <ul>
                                <li>The Company declared that the "unjust demands" of the nawabs were ruining its trade.</li>
                                <li>It believed trade could only flourish if duties were removed.</li>
                                <li>To expand its trade, the Company felt it needed to enlarge its settlements, buy villages, and rebuild its forts.</li>
                           </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                <div class="answer">
                    <p>When the Mughal emperor appointed the Company as the Diwan of Bengal in 1765, it was a major turning point that benefited the Company immensely:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Access to Vast Revenues:</strong> The Diwani allowed the Company to use the vast revenue resources of Bengal.</li>
                        <li><strong>Financing Expenses:</strong> The Company could now use Indian revenues to finance all its expenses. This included purchasing cotton and silk textiles in India, maintaining its troops, and paying for the construction of forts and offices.</li>
                        <li><strong>End of Gold and Silver Import:</strong> Before the Diwani, the Company had to import gold and silver from Britain to buy goods in India. After 1765, this outflow of treasure from Britain completely stopped, as the Company could use Bengal's revenue for all its purchases.</li>

                <div class="answer">
                    <p>The "subsidiary alliance" was a political method used by the British to extend their influence over Indian kingdoms without direct military attack. The key terms of this alliance were:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>No Independent Army:</strong> Indian rulers were not allowed to have their own independent armed forces.</li>
                        <li><strong>British Protection:</strong> They were to be "protected" by the Company's forces, known as "subsidiary forces".</li>
                        <li><strong>Payment for Protection:</strong> The Indian rulers had to pay for these subsidiary forces.</li>
                        <li><strong>Penalty for Non-payment:</strong> If an Indian ruler failed to make the payment, a part of their territory was taken away as a penalty. For example, the Nawab of Awadh had to give up half of his territory in 1801 for failing to pay.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This system effectively made Indian states dependent on the Company and led to a loss of their sovereignty.</p>

                <div class="answer">
                    <p>The administration of the Company was different from that of Indian rulers in several significant ways:</p>
                     <ul>
                        <li><strong>Administrative Units:</strong> The British divided their territories into administrative units called Presidencies (Bengal, Madras, and Bombay), each ruled by a Governor. The supreme head was the Governor-General. Indian kingdoms were typically divided into provinces or subas under local governors or zamindars.</li>
                        <li><strong>System of Justice:</strong> The British established a new, uniform system of justice from 1772. Each district had a criminal court (faujdari adalat) and a civil court (diwani adalat). They also compiled codes of Hindu and Muslim laws to bring about uniformity.</li>
                        <li><strong>The Collector:</strong> The principal figure in a district became the Collector, whose main job was to collect revenue and maintain law and order. This single post replaced the previous, more varied holders of authority in Indian states.</li>

                <div class="answer">
                    <p>The composition of the Company's army, known as the sepoy army, underwent significant changes over time:</p>
                     <ul>
                        <li><strong>Shift from Cavalry to Infantry:</strong> The Mughal army was dominated by cavalry (sawars or soldiers on horseback). The Company initially adopted this but later shifted its focus. As warfare technology changed in the 1820s (with the introduction of muskets and matchlocks), the need for cavalry declined and infantry regiments became more important.</li>
                        <li><strong>Professional Training:</strong> Unlike the Mughal army, which often used armed peasants supplied by zamindars, the Company recruited peasants and trained them as professional soldiers.</li>
                        <li><strong>Uniform Military Culture:</strong> In the early nineteenth century, the British introduced a uniform military culture. Soldiers were subjected to European-style training, drill, and discipline. This sometimes created problems because it ignored the caste and community feelings of the sepoys.</li>
