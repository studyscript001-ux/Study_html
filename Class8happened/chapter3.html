                <div class="answer">
                    The Giant is called selfish because he built a high wall around his beautiful garden to prevent children from playing in it. He wanted to keep the garden all to himself and didn't want to share it with anyone else.

                <div class="answer">
                    In both cases, the children are referring to the Giant's garden. The first time, they say "How happy we are here!" while playing in the garden. Later, after the Giant bans them, they say "How happy we were there!" remembering their joyful times in the garden.

                <div class="answer">
                    (i) Winter in the garden indicates sadness, loneliness, and the absence of life and joy. It represents the Giant's selfishness and how it has affected the garden.<br>
                    (ii) In the story, Winter is personified with characters like Snow, Frost, North Wind, and Hail. They decide to live in the Giant's garden all year round because Spring has forgotten it. Snow covers the grass with her white cloak, Frost paints the trees silver, North Wind roars all day, and Hail rattles on the roof and runs around the garden.

                <div class="answer">
                    The Giant was sad over the state of the garden. He wondered why Spring was so late in coming and hoped for a change in the weather. He missed the beauty and joy that used to be in his garden.

                    The linnet's song made the Hail stop dancing over the Giant's head and the North Wind cease roaring. The beautiful music signaled the arrival of Spring and ended the reign of winter in the garden.

                    (ii) On seeing this, the Giant realized how selfish he had been and understood why Spring had not come to his garden. He realized that his selfishness had kept joy and beauty away.

                    It was still winter in one corner of the garden because a little boy was standing there who couldn't reach the branches of the tree to climb up. The tree was still covered with frost and snow, and the North Wind was blowing above it.

                    During their first meeting, the Giant found the little boy crying because he couldn't reach the branches of the tree. The Giant's heart melted, and he felt sorry for being selfish. He gently took the boy in his hands and put him up into the tree. The tree immediately broke into blossom, and the boy kissed the Giant in gratitude.

                    In their second meeting after many years, the Giant saw the little boy standing under a tree covered with white blossoms in the farthest corner of the garden. The tree had golden branches with silver fruit. When the Giant approached, he saw wounds on the boy's hands and feet. The boy explained they were "the wounds of Love" and invited the Giant to come with him to his garden, which was paradise.

                <div class="answer">
                    The child reminds us of Jesus Christ. The marks of nails on his hands and feet are similar to the wounds Jesus received when he was crucified. The child's statement that these are "the wounds of Love" further reinforces this connection, as Christian theology teaches that Jesus sacrificed himself out of love for humanity.

                <div class="answer">
                    [This is a personal question. Students should answer based on their own experiences. Example answer:] Yes, there is a public park near where I live, but it's not as beautiful as the Giant's garden. I would love to have a garden like that because it would be a peaceful place to play, relax, and connect with nature. To keep it in good shape, I would help by not plucking flowers, not littering, watering plants, and encouraging others to respect the garden.
