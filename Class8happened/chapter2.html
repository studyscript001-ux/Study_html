                    Velu felt this way because he had been traveling on the train for a long time. His legs had become accustomed to the movement of the train, so even after getting off, he felt unsteady and wobbly, as if the ground was still moving beneath him.

                    Velu can read Tamil but not English. We know this because when he saw signs in English, he didn't understand them, but he could read the Tamil sign for "Central Jail."

                    Velu shows both smart and not-so-smart qualities. He is smart enough to run away from an abusive home and find his way to a big city. He is also observant, noticing details about his surroundings. However, he is naive about city life and doesn't have a plan for survival, which shows his lack of experience and foresight.

                    Yes, Jaya is brave, sensitive, and has a sense of humor. She shows courage by living independently in a big city and navigating its dangers. She shows kindness by helping Velu find food and offering him work. Her sense of humor is evident in her witty remarks, such as when she tells Velu he'll become "chutney" if he stands in the road or when she jokes about the Central Jail.

                <div class="answer">
                    Yes, this sentence is very meaningful in the context of the story. The entire livelihood of Jaya and other ragpickers depends on items that people throw away as waste. They collect paper, plastic, glass, and other materials that can be recycled and sold. Even the food they eat is often leftover from events, which would otherwise be wasted. This shows that what is worthless to some people can be valuable to others.
