                    The forest pool was clean, cold, and inviting with gentle translucency and smooth round pebbles at the bottom. In contrast, the pools in the Rajputana desert were sticky, muddy pools where buffaloes wallowed and women washed clothes.

                    (i) He expected Ranji to apologize and leave the pool, acknowledging that it belonged to him.<br>
                    (ii) In my opinion, he was wrong to ask this question because no one can claim ownership of a natural resource like a forest pool. Everyone should have the right to enjoy nature's gifts.

                    (i) He said this because neither boy was willing to back down or leave the pool, creating a stalemate.<br>

                <div class="answer">
                    Ranji goes back to the pool because not turning up would be an acknowledgement of defeat. He believes that as long as he fights, he has a right to the pool, even if he gets beaten.

                <div class="answer">
                    Ranji was the better swimmer. We know this because he could dive straight into the water, cut through it like a knife, surface with hardly a splash, and swim underwater—skills that Suraj didn't have.

                    They don't continue the fight because Suraj becomes more interested in learning how to dive and swim underwater from Ranji. Their competitive energy transforms into curiosity and mutual respect.

                <div class="answer">
                    The two adversaries turn into good friends because they discover mutual respect and shared interests. Ranji's swimming skills impress Suraj, and Suraj's strength and determination impress Ranji. Instead of focusing on their differences, they recognize each other's strengths and realize they can learn from each other. This shift from competition to cooperation helps them form a friendship.

                    [This is a personal question. Students should answer based on their own experiences. Example answer:] Yes, I once had a serious argument with my best friend over something trivial. We didn't talk to each other for days, and both of us were unhappy. Later, we realized that our friendship was more important than the argument, and we apologized to each other. It taught me that many fights are unnecessary and that communication is key to resolving conflicts.

Will you be amused or annoyed to read the following sign at the back of the car in front of you? "I may be going slow but I am ahead of you."</div>
                <div class="answer">
                    Some people feel the need to prove they are better than others due to insecurity, the desire for validation, or competitive nature. This need often stems from a lack of self-confidence or the belief that one's worth depends on being superior to others.<br><br>
                    I would be amused by the sign because it's humorous and shows the driver doesn't take themselves too seriously. It's a lighthearted way of acknowledging that even if they're not the fastest, they're still making progress.
