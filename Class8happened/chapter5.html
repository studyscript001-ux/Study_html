                    The Queen found it confusing to remember so many names, so the King decided to name them after the months of the year to make it easier.

                    The "circumstances" refer to Princess September's anxiety about the bird not returning and her sisters' advice to cage him. The "unfortunate remark" was when the bird mentioned that he almost didn't come back that night because he was enjoying the party at his father-in-law's. This remark increased September's fear of losing him, making her decide to cage him for safety.

                <div class="answer">
                    The bird refused to be taken out in the cage because things looked quite different when seen through the bars of a cage. He wanted to experience freedom and see the trees, lake, and rice fields without obstruction.

                    (ii) The bird was grateful and promised to always come back, sing beautiful songs for her, and never forget her. He flew away into the blue sky.

                <div class="answer">
                    The most important idea in this story is the value of freedom. The story clearly shows that the bird couldn't sing or be happy when caged, even in a golden cage. True love means wanting what's best for the loved one, even if it means giving up our own desires. Princess September learned that putting the bird's happiness before her own eventually brought her greater happiness in return. The contrast between September's open window and her sisters' shut windows further emphasizes how freedom leads to beauty and happiness, while restriction leads to ugliness and discontent.
