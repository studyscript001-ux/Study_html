                    (ii) Yes, the coins were misguiding him because they were encouraging him to spend money that was meant for his school fees on temporary pleasure, which could lead to problems later.

                        <li>He was afraid of facing Master Ghulam Mohammed and Allah miyan if he spent the money</li>

                <div class="answer">
                    (i) The oldest coin told him that if he spent the fees money on jalebis that day, he could pay the fees with the scholarship money he would get the next day.<br>
                    (ii) Initially, he didn't follow the advice. He clenched the rupees in his fist and went home, deciding it wasn't right for a child of his status to stand in the bazaar eating jalebis.

                <div class="answer">
                    When he reached home, the coins continued their attempts at persuasion. They kept speaking until their voices began to choke. When he sat on the bed, they began to speak again. When he went inside to have lunch, they began to shriek. Finally, fed up, he rushed out barefoot and ran towards the bazaar to buy jalebis.

                    The fear was that with every burp, he might bring out a jalebi or two, revealing that he had eaten jalebis. He was also afraid that if he didn't eat dinner, he would have to explain why, and if he pretended illness, the doctor might discover he had eaten too many jalebis.

                        <li>He is a good boy who has memorized the entire namaaz and last ten surats of the Quran</li>

                <div class="answer">
                    If God had granted his wish, he might have never learned the importance of responsibility and consequences. He might have continued to believe that he could solve problems by simply asking God for help rather than through his own efforts. The author later realizes that if Allah provided everything for the asking, humans wouldn't have learned to make jalebis or develop other skills and would still be living in nests like birds.

                    <strong>Temptation:</strong> "Those fresh, hot jalebis coming out of the kadhai in the shop over there, they're not coming out for nothing."<br><br>
                    <strong>Guilt:</strong> "I am a good boy. Don't misguide me or it won't be good for you. I get so much at home that I consider even looking at something in the bazaar a sin."<br><br>
                    <strong>Justification:</strong> "Eat jalebis with the fees money and then pay the fees with the scholarship money. I thought that two and two added up to four and could never be five."

If so, what is the evidence of it?<br>- Does his outlook on the jalebis episode change after Class VIII? Does he see that episode in a new light?<br>- Why are coins made to 'talk' in this story? What purpose does it serve?</div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <strong>Intelligence:</strong> Yes, the boy is intelligent. He was among the most promising students, won a scholarship, and could recite many verses from the Quran. He also tried to logically justify his actions.<br><br>
                    <strong>Changed outlook:</strong> Yes, his outlook changes after Class VIII. He realizes that if God provided everything for the asking, humans wouldn't have developed skills and would still be living primitive lives. He understands the importance of human effort and learning from mistakes.<br><br>
                    <strong>Coins talking:</strong> The coins are personified to represent the boy's inner temptation and internal conflict. This literary device makes the story more engaging and helps readers understand the struggle between responsibility and desire that the boy experiences.
