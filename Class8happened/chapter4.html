                    Hafeez Contractor had nightmares about appearing for a mathematics examination where he did not know anything. These nightmares continued for many years until they eventually disappeared.

                    The Principal told Hafeez that he had been a good student but never studied. He reminded Hafeez that his mother had worked hard to bring him up and pay his fees, and now it was time for him to rise to the occasion and study seriously.

                    (ii) [This is a personal question. Students should answer based on their own opinion. Example answer:] While it might have been fun to play games instead of studying, I believe it's important to respect classroom rules and focus on learning.

                    Hafeez didn't join the police force because his mother advised him against it. She told him to complete his graduation instead, so he went to Jaihind College in Bombay.

                    Hafeez helped fellow students who had lost a button by cutting a button for them from chalk using a blade. This was important because discipline in the school required students to have a complete uniform.

                    (ii) [This is a personal question. Students should answer based on their own understanding.

I find mathematics challenging but interesting because it helps develop analytical thinking skills.

                <div class="answer">
                    Yes, it is quite likely that someone who is original and intelligent might not do well in traditional school settings. Such a learner should not be called a failure because intelligence and talent can manifest in different ways. The education system often focuses on specific types of intelligence and learning styles, which may not align with every student's strengths. Hafeez Contractor is a perfect example - he struggled with formal education but excelled in architecture due to his visual thinking and creative skills.

                <div class="answer">
                    An 'unusual' learner is someone who doesn't fit the traditional mold of academic success. They may struggle with conventional teaching methods and standardized testing but excel in practical, creative, or hands-on learning. These learners often think differently, have unique perspectives, and may demonstrate talents in areas not typically emphasized in formal education, such as problem-solving, innovation, or artistic expression.
