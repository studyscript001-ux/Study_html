                    The dog was assigned to fetch and carry things with his mouth. The ox was assigned to plough the fields with a yoke on his neck.

                    The camel lived in the middle of the desert because he did not want to work. He was lazy and preferred to eat sticks, thorns, and prickles instead of working like other animals.

                <div class="answer">
                    The dog, horse, and ox were angry because the camel refused to work, and as a result, they had to work double-time to make up for the camel's idleness. The man told them they must work extra because the camel wouldn't work.

                <div class="answer">
                    The Djinn was in charge of all deserts and had special powers. When the horse described an animal with a long neck and long legs who hadn't worked since Monday, the Djinn immediately recognized it was the camel he was responsible for.

                <div class="answer">
                    This suggests that the camel was proud and vain. He was admiring himself and his appearance instead of working like the other animals.

                <div class="answer">
                    Every time the camel said "Humph", it caused his back to puff up into a hump. When he said it to the Djinn after being warned not to, his back swelled into a big hump that became permanent.

                <div class="answer">
                    According to the Djinn, the hump would allow the camel to work for three days without eating. The camel could live on his hump, which stored energy, making up for the three days of work he had missed at the beginning of the world.

                <div class="answer">
                    The writer suggests that the camel never improved his lazy behavior. Even after getting the hump and being forced to work, the camel remained ill-mannered and didn't change his attitude toward work.

                    No, this story cannot be factually true. It is a fable - a fictional story meant to teach a moral lesson. The story uses animals that talk and a magical Djinn to explain how the camel got its hump, which is not scientifically accurate but serves to convey an important message about the value of hard work.

                    [This is a personal question. Students should answer based on their own work habits.
